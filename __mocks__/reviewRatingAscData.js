Everything we had was sort of meh...\\n\\nStarted with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn\\'t have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\\n\\nMy steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how \\\"they cook their steaks\\\" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\\n\\nCreamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can\\'t screw up right? It\\'s got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn\\'t even eat half of it.\\n\\nVery disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately. Don\\'t bother.",

I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don\\'t bother with this one....",

My husband\\'s was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen.

Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \\n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\\n- The fried apple pies were adequate.

Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \\\"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\\\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \\\"let somebody know\\\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.",

Of course we occommidated them becuase once started eating the food was certainly good quality but way over salted. It was very pasty. Odds are unless someone else insists I wont be visting again. Why when there are so many other great choices. One more thing. The restaurant really had no theme.  White walls coupled with the staff it felt like an expensive hospital cafeteria.",
