They had a carmelized onion,Mushroom mixture with a Parmesan crust that absolutely sent them into Orbit !!!!! Not to mention the Prime Dry Aged Filet that was literally \\\"Cake\\\" tender and had a deep beef flavor. We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it\\'s to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were \\\"dudded up\\\". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else\\'s had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service",

Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \\n\\nWe ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre \\'d. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I\\'m a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!\\n\\nFor dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril\\'s shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!\\n\\nThis is a place you probably wouldn\\'t wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it\\'s best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\\n\\n*Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!",

We had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\\n\\nThe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER.\\n- EMERIL\\'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\\n- GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren\\'t very tasty to me.\\n- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\\n- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn\\'t seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\\n\\nSides:\\n- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\\n- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\\n\\nAll in all, a great experience. We weren\\'t too full at the end of the meal, and didn\\'t have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",

I\\'m drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).\\n\\nI loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.\\n\\nBefore we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\\n\\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\\n\\nI had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming\\'s. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn\\'t even want to dip it in Emeril\\'s version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it\\'s an Emeril restaurant.. didn\\'t know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\\n\\nWe shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn\\'t use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\\n\\nLastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.",

This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don\\'t even come close to this one.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.\\n\\nGive this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.",
