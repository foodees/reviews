So instead of Fleming\\'s, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend\\'s bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\\n\\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\\n\\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\\n\\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\\n\\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I\\'ve seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\\n\\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\\n\\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\\n\\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\\n\\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden, \\nPicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.",

          "text": "Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\\n\\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn\\'t the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\\n\\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\\\"Would you like some more bread sir?\\\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \\\"Better!\\\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\\n\\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\\n\\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\\n\\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.",

It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent.\\n\\nMy steak was almost reasonable.

          "text": "Superb!\\n\\nI\\'m sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn\\'t come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\\n\\nI\\'m not a big fan of Ermiril\\'s show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he\\'s not the one cooking my meal, then it\\'s not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio\\'s buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you\\'re saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\\n\\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn\\'t stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet\\'s looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn\\'t a proper meal we would\\'ve gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \\\"Generous Cut\\\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\\n\\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I\\'ve ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\\n\\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They\\'re one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\\n\\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.",

Even though there is so much good food to choose from in Vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    We\\'ve heard a lot of good things about Delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.   \\n\\nFirst things first.  Service was great.   We came late for our reservation.  No problem.   Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\\n\\nThe important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I\\'m paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don\\'t get me wrong, you\\'ll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money\\'s worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico\\'s steaks.\\n\\nThat being said, if you do go to Dominico\\'s, definitely get the sautee\\'d mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!",

          "text": "Delmonico\\'s is an institution - but it\\'s by no means a \\\"5-Star\\\" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn\\'t the founder of the original Delmonico\\'s of New Orleans.\\n\\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico\\'s serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who\\'ve been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \\\"Commander\\'s Palace\\\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \\\"Delmonico\\'s\\\".    And that\\'s a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I\\'ve ever eaten was at the New Orleans\\' Delmonico\\'s... not the Vegas location.\\n\\nGOOD NEWS:  IT\\'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\\nBut I don\\'t think you\\'ll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it\\'s all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\\n\\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\\nHere\\'s the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\\n1) FLAVOR\\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico\\'s and I think Charlie Palmer\\'s outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina\\'s StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It\\'s probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \\n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \\n2) SERVICE\\nIf you\\'re looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it\\'s hard to beat Delmonico\\'s.  That\\'s something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer\\'s probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there\\'s rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I\\'ve consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\\n3) DÉCOR\\nIt\\'s darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I\\'ve noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I\\'m not sure this is really a big point.  \\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nDelmonico\\'s, while it\\'s lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\\n\\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\\n\\n-----------------\\nINSIDER\\'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO\\'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d\\' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You\\'ll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \\n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico\\'s in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I\\'ve pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d\\' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \\n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on \\'immediate seating\\' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu\\'s really has no such seating other than \\\"next table available\\\")",
