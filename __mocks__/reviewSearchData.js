The steaks had absolutely NO flavor, the options weren\\'t good and the ahi salad with a whopping 3 small pieces of tuna was far from worth the cost. I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don\\'t bother with this one....",

the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\\n\\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie\\'s Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city\\'s best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\\n\\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril\\'s famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.",

It was early in the evening and the place was not packed so to wait for 20 minutes for a steak seams a little too long.  Either way, that evened out to being about average for a place that was pretty expensive price point.",

          "text": "Located inside my favorite hotel Venetian, Delmonico is one of Emeril\\'s restaurant. When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you\\'re inside a European gallery. \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \\n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you\\'re into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \\n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I\\'ve had. \\n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn\\'t expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that\\'s was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \\n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \\n\\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.",

Everything we had was sort of meh...\\n\\nStarted with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn\\'t have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\\n\\nMy steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how \\\"they cook their steaks\\\" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\\n\\nCreamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can\\'t screw up right? It\\'s got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn\\'t even eat half of it.\\n\\nVery disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately. Don\\'t bother.",

          "text": "My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn\\'t always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn\\'t say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn\\'t feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn\\'t make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn\\'t need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn\\'t get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.",
