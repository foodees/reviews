So instead of Fleming\\'s, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend\\'s bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\\n\\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\\n\\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\\n\\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\\n\\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I\\'ve seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\\n\\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\\n\\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\\n\\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\\n\\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden, \\nPicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.",

            "text": "Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\\n\\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn\\'t the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\\n\\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\\\"Would you like some more bread sir?\\\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \\\"Better!\\\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\\n\\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\\n\\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\\n\\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.",

Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he\\'s not the one cooking my meal, then it\\'s not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio\\'s buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you\\'re saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\\n\\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn\\'t stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet\\'s looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn\\'t a proper meal we would\\'ve gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \\\"Generous Cut\\\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\\n\\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I\\'ve ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\\n\\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They\\'re one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\\n\\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.",

I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead. \\n\\nHere\\'s the salient-\\n\\nService\\nThe Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I\\'m from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch. \\n\\nFood\\n- The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.\\n- The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \\n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\\n- The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.",

The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \\n\\nI tried other dishes my friends got and they weren\\'t as good. My friends didn\\'t really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn\\'t really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too. \\n\\nIf you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It\\'s a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.",

I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \\n\\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\\n\\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\\n\\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \\n\\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.
