It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \\n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\\n- The fried apple pies were adequate.

            "text": "Dinner with my wife and 6 family members...no problem with reservations for this large part of a party.  Service was outstanding!  We all agreed that the steaks were some of the best we had ever eaten!  Seafood tower was very good!  Sides were very tasty and the creamed corn was SO GOOD!  Not sure how they prepared it, but it was some of the best ever.  Will definitely include this restaurant in our future visits to Las Vegas!",

Why did I come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the Las Vegas strip?\\n\\n1 reason: Truffle Parmesan potato chips. they are like crack, you simply can\\'t stop eating them :)\\n\\nI ordered the Certified Piedmontese steak, NY Strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. At 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.\\n\\nGirlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and said it was very good.\\n\\nService is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at Delmoncio!",

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\\n\\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \\n\\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\\n\\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\\n\\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \\n\\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there\\'ll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.",

So happy to see foie gras on their menu but it was just ok - I\\'ve had better.  The scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  Everything else was ok.
