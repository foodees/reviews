the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\\n\\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie\\'s Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city\\'s best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\\n\\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril\\'s famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.",

It was early in the evening and the place was not packed so to wait for 20 minutes for a steak seams a little too long.  Either way, that evened out to being about average for a place that was pretty expensive price point.",

            "text": "Located inside my favorite hotel Venetian, Delmonico is one of Emeril\\'s restaurant. When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you\\'re inside a European gallery. \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \\n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you\\'re into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \\n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I\\'ve had. \\n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn\\'t expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that\\'s was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \\n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \\n\\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.",

LOVED the popovers.\\n\\nThe service was weird... our waiter was knowledgeable and professional but seemed preoccupied, always looking around while talking to us. There was a group at the table next to us and he seemed much more attentive to them. \\n\\nAnother waiter came over at the end of our dinner and we asked what spice was used in the waffle- he said he didn\\'t know. I then asked where The Dorsey was in proximity to the restaurant, he said- again, I don\\'t know........ he didn\\'t even attempt to answer our questions. Great food, less than adequate service.",
