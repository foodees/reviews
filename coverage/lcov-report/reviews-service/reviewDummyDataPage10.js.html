            "text": "My Husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I\\'ve never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I\\'ve ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I\\'ve had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn\\'t care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn\\'t finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it\\'s worth every calorie that\\'s probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it\\'s amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge",

            "text": "Was excited to go here since it was Emerille\\'s Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.\\n\\nI ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.",

            "text": "We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \\n\\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\\n\\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn\\'t really care for the seasoning either, but that\\'s a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband\\'s rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \\n\\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \\\"Emerel\\'s Blend\\\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.",

            "text": "First impressions......Unfortunately, Delmonico Steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \\n\\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \\n\\nFood-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\\n\\nThe cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT\\'s version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.",

            "text": "Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I\\'ve had nor without flaws.\\n\\nThe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn\\'t a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I\\'d say the food part of Emeril\\'s more or less did the trick with regards to that.\\n\\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre\\'d was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn\\'t feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre\\'d didn\\'t really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \\n\\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn\\'t fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to rip Delmonico\\'s so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn\\'t deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \\\"double-baked potato\\\" + \\\"Asparagus\\\" was fantastic.\\n\\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I\\'ve had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar\\'s Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\\n\\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \\n\\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.",
