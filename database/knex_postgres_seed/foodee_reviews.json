The BBQ and noodle dishes are not be as good as other places, but they get a pass because they stay open way late.  So really the main reason to come here is because most of the better HK places have already closed; and if it\\'s that late at night, chances are you\\'ll be pretty drunk so the food will be perfectly acceptable.",

They brought out a few small appetizers and a complimentary glass of Champaign and a small bouquet of yellow and orange Daisy\\'s for  my birthday. I ordered the seafood platter it was great. then I ordered the 6  oz filet mignon cooked to perfection med rare and great flavor melt in my mouth. My husband has the rack of Lamb that was the best he has ever had for dinning out. Oh and yes the muffins they bring before the meal are absolutely the best. . I will go back for sure!!!!  Even the chef came out to wish me a Happy Birthday ... it was by far the best Birthday dinner ever.. oh did I mention the person crusted banana cream pie with Carmel drizzled over the top .... need I say anymore.

      "text": "My fiancé had just purchased a car and we were unusually in the area to pick up the title. We stroll in for something to eat, and find that it\\'s very obviously family-owned. I love places like this, but my experience here was a bit...uncertain. \\n\\nI ordered a customized soup with rice noodles and shrimp and pork dumplings, and the fiancé ordered a grilled chicken dish. Hands down, the best grilled chicken I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of eating. It was surprisingly amazing. Moist, tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The light char on it was fantastic. The side of rice was also delicious. \\n\\nThe soup, however, was a little off. The broth was tasty, and the noodles were cooked perfectly...but I\\'m inclined to believe that the dumplings had me doubled over an hour later (give or take). I bit into a single one and knew something was wrong. The waitress must have seen the perplexed look upon my face, because she came over asking me specifically if everything was alright (she was really sweet). I told her it was fine, because, honestly, we\\'ve all either endured the dark happenings of restaurants first hand, or have watched Waiting. I won\\'t send food back and order anything afterwards. (Definitely not saying that this establishment would purposefully contaminate my food, but, from experience, I just don\\'t feel comfortable doing it.)\\n\\nI drank the broth, ate the noodles, and built up the guts to try one more dumpling. That one tasted perfectly fine. Delicious, in fact. But it may have been a single, fluke dumpling that kept me clutching at my disgruntled tummy for hours after. However, I cannot directly make that claim, nor do I want to. \\n\\nFlan (free with Yelp Check-in) was so awesome. I\\'d consider it a fairly dense flan, maybe a pudding, but it was great, nonetheless. In my top five. \\n\\nOverall, the food was quick to come out. Our waitress was very sweet and insanely adorable. The food itself was delicious, though I continue to question. And the establishment is very clean with cute decor. I\\'ll take a second chance here, if we\\'re ever that far from the center of town.",

The bar was dark with a few slots and seemed like a cool place.  The dining room, once we got through the sensor, was nice enough.  Clean, very quiet, and comfy with two large-screen tvs and nice cloth napkins.  Enough on the aesthetics.  \\n\\nMy wife and I ordered the filet mignons with salads and baked potatoes.  They steaks were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor and were very tender.  The baked potatoes were rolled in a salt/pepper mix and were great.  The salad was a basic variety dish.  We were extremely pleased with the service, food, price, and atmosphere.  It was really a neat experience.  The only suggestion I would make to them would be to have better servings of butter.  They were way too small and many had to be used. \\n\\nBut wait, there\\'s more!   We went back the next morning for breakfast.  We had the French toast and bacon.  Again, the French toast was fantastic and the bacon was to die for.  Couldn\\'t have been more pleased. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in the area (we were in the adjacent RV park) it is well worth your visiting.  Great place at a great value.",

      "text": "2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #2. \\n\\nWhether you\\'re visiting Delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during Restaurant Week as I did, from the amazing lunch I had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, I\\'d recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.\\n\\nWe seem to be the first party seated for lunch. Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\\n\\nWhat we put in our tummies:\\n(pictures posted)\\n\\n1st Course\\nTraditional New Orleans\\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\\n\\n2nd Course\\nButternut Squash Ravioli\\nPrime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\\n\\n3rd Course\\nEmeril\\'s Banana Cream Pie\\nPecan Pie\\n\\nI\\'m no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\\n\\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I\\'m a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it\\'s written \\\"Emeril\\'s Banana Cream Pie.\\\" I\\'m sure it\\'s not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\\n\\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I\\'ve been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \\n\\nPersonally, I\\'m very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It\\'s so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \\n\\nI\\'m very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!",

We ordered their lollipop passion goblet which is described on the menu as \\\"a wonderful mix of melon, coconut and pineapple blended together to create a taste sensation no one will be able to resist! Garnished with lollipops\\\" Our goblet came to the table and it is huge, I am glad the husband and I decided to share this drink. It had two huge rainbow lollipops and a candy necklace inside. The server pours our drink and we were surprised it had some kind of dry ice or something in it to make the drink bubble and smoke. (It was super neat) We had great service, the woman who took care of us was very attentive even though we only came in to order a drink to share. The drinks are expensive though and I wish I knew beforehand that yelp has a special. If you check in on yelp you get 50% off your goblet drink, which would have saved us at least $25, but you live and you learn! Next time I would for sure use the check in offer if it is still available. \\nOverall the drink was super refreshing and not too sweet. We will return. The decor of the restaurant is super cute, they have awesome looking food and great service.",

I\\'m drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).\\n\\nI loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.\\n\\nBefore we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\\n\\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\\n\\nI had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming\\'s. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn\\'t even want to dip it in Emeril\\'s version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it\\'s an Emeril restaurant.. didn\\'t know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\\n\\nWe shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn\\'t use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\\n\\nLastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.",

      "text": "Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\\n\\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn\\'t the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\\n\\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\\\"Would you like some more bread sir?\\\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \\\"Better!\\\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\\n\\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\\n\\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\\n\\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.",

I only gave it a 4* rating because of the later part of the smoky part. \\n\\nWe had a lay over in Vegas on our way to Utah on vacation and the Hitching Post is also a motel RV park, so we lucked out they had a diner attached. \\n\\nAs I said when you walk in you immediately are blasted with smoke since you have to go through the bar to get to a room that is glassed off and a sensor you wave your hand in front of to open the sliding doors. The waitress asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or the dining room. We opted for the somewhat smokeless dining room. Wish we would of sat outside it would of been warmer. \\n\\nWe were promptly given menus and our drink order taken. No Dr. Pepper was not a plus for me. So I opted for coke that still tasted like coke from the gun in a bar. Otherwise there was a pretty nice menu to choose from. Usual diner options. Burgers, sandwiches, salads and steaks. \\n\\nI chose the grilled cheese with 3 types of cheese. Pepper jack, cheddar and Swiss on rye bread with sweet potato fries. My husband selected the chef salad with ranch dressing. Funny but our companions had exactly what we had. \\n\\nThe sandwich was perfectly toasted, not greasy. Fries were crispy and very good. The salads were full of ingredients and the boys really liked them. The only complaint I heard was they didn\\'t get any hard boiled egg on the salad as it said on the menu. \\n\\nThis place really did deliver a great meal at a great price and to our pleasant surprise our server asked if anyone in our party was military which there was and that just doesn\\'t happen.

The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren\\'t very tasty to me.\\n- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\\n- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn\\'t seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\\n\\nSides:\\n- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\\n- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\\n\\nAll in all, a great experience.

The manager won\\'t harass you for leaving a review on yelp and stare at you every time you walk by the establishment.  The Burger King manager doesn\\'t care.  Black bears manager?  Takes it personally and makes you feel sorry for having a bad experience.  Too bad.  \\n\\nIf you would like a place to hang out after Burger King, check out a coffee shop, go to the library, or take some yoga at RYK, right across the street.  You will spend the same amount of money (because black bear is over priced for its portions), and you will feel social:-))",

I didn\\'t want to fall into the gimmick of paying more money for something just because it now comes in a different shape / form. Plus some places are stingy and will give you a tiny portion. Not Jaburritos! I shared the Redondo (ahi, salmon, yellowtail) with my boyfriend and was surprised by how full I got just eating half. The fish was fresh, and I was able to taste it in every bite (so it wasn\\'t just a bunch of fillers). Not bad for $13. It\\'s essentially the same price as a specialty roll.\\n\\nWe also ordered the sushi cupcakes. It came with 4: crab, smoked salmon, and 2 spicy tunas. The \\\"cup\\\" part is fried wonton skin, and the \\\"cake\\\" part is the seafood and rice. Pretty good, but a little too much sauce on all of them, so it was quite heavy. But kudos for creativity. Not sure how comparable other sushi burrito places are, but this was a great first experience!",

The Rice Shop is great because it takes elements from many cultures, combines them together in a way that compliments each other, and executed nicely. No swooshes of weird green sauces, just plenty of greens to make up for that lack of daily vegetable serving. \\n\\nMy go to\\'s are the Mochiko chicken and Kentucky fried fish.

So instead of Fleming\\'s, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend\\'s bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\\n\\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\\n\\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\\n\\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\\n\\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I\\'ve seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\\n\\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\\n\\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\\n\\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\\n\\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants.

But there\\'s a few things which make this Thai restaurant miss the mark for people who know real Thai food. \\n\\n1. Too sweet. In Thailand. Cooks add sugar to thai food to balance the sour and spice for tourists and it is a sign of a novice chef who is cooking to get a \\\"yum\\\" response and forgetting to aim for a \\\"wow\\\"\\n\\n2. No fish sauce. What Thai restaurant doesn\\'t have fish sauce on the table? That would have balanced the sugar. \\n\\n3. Portions. Massive, too big, we walked out feeling sick and only ate half. The flavour was lost in the kilogram of chicken. \\n\\n4. The prad kapow chicken normally comes with a fried egg on the rice, not the main. \\n\\n5. Not spicy, I had to add dried chilli flakes which is not Thai chili. I didn\\'t see Thai chilly except for s solid chilly. And everyone knows you chop and dice s chilly to balance the spice. Having a whole one hidden in your meal is a landmine if you\\'re not used to Thai spicy. \\n\\n6. I asked for the meal to be cooked as close to thai style as possible both in flavour and spice and it was neither flavourful or spicy. \\n\\nConclusion, if you want to get a hint of Thai food and you\\'re starving then its good. \\n\\nIf you want to taste Thai food, go somewhere else.",

      "text": "We arrived at the restaurant close to 9pm on a Saturday night. There wasn\\'t one customer in the restaurant, but that didn\\'t deter us from trying out their foods, since this restaurant had some pretty good reviews from fellow yelpers. I ordered their pho tai with raw beef on the side, spring rolls, com tam bi cha suon nuong (broken rice with grilled pork chop), and bun thit nuong (grilled beef with rice vermicelli and vegetable). We also received two free egg rolls for \\\"Checking In\\\" at their restaurant. The pho lived up to its top ranking, the broth was very flavorful, but they were a little skimpy on the noodles, IMO. My wife\\'s bun also did not have enough vermicelli in it and their fish sauce wasn\\'t as strong as some of the other restaurants in town, but not bad. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh as was their egg rolls. The pork chop with the broken rice dish was just okay. The eggs that were in this dish was quite good, but the pork chop needed more seasoning. If you come here, stick with the pho and spring/egg rolls.  After our meal, the owner brought out some Vietnamese dessert for us to try, on the house. This broken rice sweet dessert with taro and sweet potatoes were an absolute delight.  15% off my bill because I yelp. I definitely have to come back to try their $3 banh mi.",

If you are going for take out this place usually takes about 20-30 min. to prepare food, but it\\'s worth the wait in my opinion.

If you decide to dine here skip the seasonal menus as the 83rd or a scallop is a joke and the rest of the meal was substandard.

Not only was it delicious,  but it was also very beautifully presented. \\nNow, on to the main dishes... My husband ordered the chicken tagine.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the sauce was so yummy. I ordered the chicken brochette,  which is basically a kabob.  Once again, the chicken was tender and juicy and the spices that it was cooked with gave it a great flavor. It also came with saffron rice, potatoes and an incredibly yummy tomato topped with parmesean cheese and spices. For dessert,  we ordered the panna cotta. It had a great citrus flavor and was very refreshing- the perfect ending to an amazing meal!\\nWe also ordered a bottle of the Moroccan wine, which perfectly complimented the flavors of our meal. At $45/bottle,  it was totally worth it.\\nThe staff was just as great as the food.

      "text": "My wife and I have been hearing good things about this place for a while and finally decided to try it for ourselves. There is paid on-street parking not too far from the restaurant (if you\\'re driving there and not staying someplace downtown). \\n\\nIt was well worth the trip. I had the short rib fried rice and my wife had the pad thai, both of which were excellent. We also shared the Waterfall Beef appetizer, which was also delicious. The prices are very reasonable for being downtown and they had some pretty good happy hour specials (M-F from 3-6) too. The service was also good. Everyone was attentive and friendly. \\n\\nThere are a few downsides to know about if you decide to come try it out. One, it\\'s super small. They have a takeout window up front so you can conveniently get it to go, but I\\'d be surprised to hear if the max capacity was any more than 40 people. So if you go when it\\'s busy, expect a wait. Two, there are only 2 or 3 tables inside (plus the bar); everything else is outdoor seating. However, I will admit that it was over 100 degrees the day we went and the beer garden (aka an enclosed rear courtyard with a canopy and misters) was surprisingly comfortable.",

We weren\\'t really hungry so we opted for this place. It was a warm night with a bit of Vegas breeze/wind, so we sat outside. It gave us a nice view of the pool and we were semi shielded from too much wind. There was a good bunch of people out. The music was perfect. The blend of mellow but up beat Vegas. \\n\\nWe only ordered the crab cake, some drinks, and the seafood platter for two (or smaller of the two versions). The crab cake was okay. It wasn\\'t my favorite among the ones we\\'ve had. It was citrusy and.. pushed the freshness of the crab out of the food. I didn\\'t enjoy it. My husband says the cake was a three but he wouldn\\'t order it again. \\n\\nThe platter on the other hand, I\\'d order that again! It was fresh, well worth it and the kitchen did a lot to accommodate the people who are unfamiliar with cracking/de-shelling. The dish came with lobster, shrmip/prawns, oysters and I think that\\'s it? It doesn\\'t sound like much but definitely filled us up and we left happy. \\n\\nI\\'d be happy to try this place again. :)",

But just claiming you have the best steak doesn\\'t make it so.\\n\\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four.

Really good but didn\\'t blow my socks off. Third time I wanted to try a noodle soup dish but decided to stray away from my usual. I ordered the bun bo hue. The flavors were really good and melded together well but I think it was overly seasoned and slightly too thick. It was a heavier stew than what I am used to with this dish. My son had the combination fried rice. We have had fried rice in every Viet restaurant in Vegas and I would say by far, this one would be in the top 2. \\n\\nToday on this cold night I ordered a bowl of pho. It was slightly sweeter than I remembered but still good as is evident in my empty bowl. I ordered the banh mi thit nuong and a thai tea to go. When I finally tried the banh mi I was so impressed! Even as a cold sandwhich I was so happy to finally find a good banh mi in this town. The pork was a thicker cut but so incredibly tender and flavorful. It is reminiscent of a Thai beef jerky a while back but way more unctious and tender.  It is quite obvious that the marinade is comprised of many different ingredients that make it so complex that my mind and tastebuds were trying to catalogue what was all in it. Lemongrass is definitely a top ingredient that makes the meat so fragrant.  This is so beyond fish sauce and sugar like some other places :-/ The mayo seemed fresh, the pickled veggies and fresh greens just put it over the top. I\\'m so glad I finally got the banh mi. Now I know where to get them from now on!",

      "text": "For the record, I went here last Saturday, November 13th.\\n\\nSo this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I\\'m not too into planning dates, because, well, that\\'s not my job as a woman. James hadn\\'t been to Nevada so he wasn\\'t much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he\\'d pick the cuisine and I\\'d pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn\\'t really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn\\'t just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.\\n\\nWell, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I\\'ve driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro\\'s but in actuality, it\\'s a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.\\n\\nI literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn\\'t quite middle eastern but it\\'s really similar - or just enough so that it doesn\\'t much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn\\'t, and they sat us anyway, which wasn\\'t a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it\\'s very dark, so you don\\'t have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don\\'t feel as if you\\'re being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. \\n\\nWe were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I\\'m 5\\'9 and James is 6\\'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I\\'m a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. \\n\\nJames and I were given a wine menu but we didn\\'t order any booze and we weren\\'t offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That\\'s about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. \\n\\nHmmmm... I\\'m not sure how \\\"Moroccan\\\" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it\\'s a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. \\n\\nThe next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.\\'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*\\n\\nThe crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. \\n\\nThe next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn\\'t the greatest but it wasn\\'t a big deal. \\n\\nWe didn\\'t eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. \\n\\nThe dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.\\n\\nHonestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don\\'t think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let\\'s be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don\\'t know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I\\'ll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that\\'s really what it\\'s all about.",

(This is not a speedy place if you want efficiency) It\\'s a layback place where you are invited to play cards or board games and imagine you are back in a small town in Asia. The boba surpasses any spot in town and absolutely worth the wait. All the rice dishes are just as delicious and true to the traditional setups as in Asia. The stew pork rice is almost as good as grandma\\'s! Only bring your family, good friends and slow time.",

The décor is a zero.  Looks like they just moved into a four wall spot and just put a sushi bar and some tables in there.  The ceiling looks unfinished as they didn\\'t put a drop down ceiling at all which I think would help the look of the place. Definitely don\\'t be expecting an ambiance.  \\n\\nWe ordered edemame, ebi, spicy California roll and chicken fried rice.  Everything was really good.  The fried rice had slivers of almond in it which was different but really tasty.  I\\'m not sure if I have ever had almonds in my fried rice but it was a unique touch. I might just come back for that alone!  \\n\\nThe service was an \\\"eh\\\". An older woman was our server and seemed to be the only one working the tables and she didn\\'t seem all that friendly or maybe she just didn\\'t know English very well.  Minus the ambiance and service, the food was good and we will for sure give it another whirl just for the eats. ;)",

Another one of those restaurants that sort of hides in plain sight, it sits quietly next to the Commonwealth on Fremont Street between 6th and Las Vegas Blvd.\\n\\nThe menu is relatively small, but has something for most fans of Thai food.  Everything is cooked fresh, the food is delicious, and you can choose how how you\\'d like your dish to be.  Portions are just the right size for lunch and dinner.  If you order a bowl of soup though, you may end up taking some home.  You truly get a bowl of soup, but it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nThe wait staff is super friendly.  Seating is limited (some indoors and some covered on the patio in the back), and a little bit at the bar, so get there when they open, or be prepared for a small wait.  Even if you have to wait though, seats seem to open up quick enough so that the wait isn\\'t usually too bad.  And for those interested, you can see into the kitchen!\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have something already in mind, try the Awesome Flat Noodles, Ga Pow or Pad Prik with a Thai Iced Tea.  The Cucumber Salad is a fantastic side dish.  Just go.  You\\'ll thank me later.",

      "text": "First impressions......Unfortunately, Delmonico Steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \\n\\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \\n\\nFood-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\\n\\nThe cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT\\'s version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.",

I haven\\'t heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \\n\\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn\\'t too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn\\'t finish it. \\n\\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn\\'t able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn\\'t complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn\\'t order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \\n\\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \\n\\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.",

It was beautiful...deep red spicy broth, perfectly boiled ramen noodles and a mish mash of exotic vegetables. I added their buttered corn and boy was that a tasty little surprise! I am such a fan. Flavorful and hearty. My lunch was perfect.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small but so charming...like right out of Japan. The wait staff are extremely friendly. Prices are OK (about $9 for a bowl).

I mean 90% of the meat is the fat.. on top of the mayo and sunny side up, I\\'m pretty sure ur cholesterol will go up.! hardly any meat or any other ingridients for sisig... it was just nice looking in color with peppers but the flavor and the quality is poor!!! very poor.. then we ordered the lechon kawali pork bellywith Java garlic rice, again the rice was salty and the pork/meat not crispy at all the skin!!! that\\'s Lechon kawali! it\\'s supposed to be crispy. and of course it\\'s bathing in the oil even though I asked them to drain it well... the skin of the pork is so thin and not crispy or crunchy!!! more like hard to bite skin... the sauce is ok. and the rice was very salty again. so there you go. u decide if u still want to try their food. i hope they are consistent with the quality and flavor because if not this resto will not last a long time, I\\'d give it a couple more months if it continues to be like this. am I coming back? not anymore. just disappointed and just dnt want to make that trip wasted. if it\\'s just one food has the problem it should be ok. but all 3 of them scores 1 out of 10 for me! so I hope my review helps U decide!",

To this day my wife says she felt fine the next day and didn\\'t have much of a hangover, then I remind her she didn\\'t wake up till 5PM the next day.... we still talk about that place.

This location has an amazingly friendly team, so I see why it\\'s crowded a lot. My bartenders Jeremy & Chris are THE BEST. Funny and attentive, did I mention funny. These 2 seem to work well together and seem to enjoy their job. My order has NEVER been wrong. Which seems impossible but they are just that good. Also, your greeter (he wears bowties) is a sweetheart, he remembers me every time. Great Job hiring Great People. Thank You, I am a loyal fan!! #CheesecakeFactory",

Definitely felt like a Bellagio restaurant.\\n\\nAlthough they have a \\\"tasting menu\\\" that seemed pretty good for the price, Kristin C. and I opted for selected our own entrees.  We started with the steak tartare salad and I ordered the sashimi plate.  The steak tartare salad was pretty good although they could have put less steak and more vegetables.  The sashimi was good, but it wasn\\'t amazing.  For our main courses, we got the lobster pot pie and Mediterranean grill plate.  The lobster pot pie is one of their signature dishes and it definitely did not disappoint.  The lobster pieces were generous.  The Mediterranean plate was pretty good, but it wasn\\'t amazing.  It had grilled calamari and prawns, but it wasn\\'t anything to write home about.\\n\\nThe big winner in my mind, however, was the black truffle potato puree.  Anything with truffles is a win in my book, and that puree was no different.  It was creamy and had the right amount of flavor. Delicious.\\n\\nIn the end, without any beverages, our bill came out to $199 without tip.  Kinda pricey, but not too bad for a fancy meal.",

I was thinking wow, that is a bit pricey for a panini.\\n\\nWaited about 10 minutes. When I got it, the sandwich was about the size of an Earl\\'s sandwich, about 6 inches. Basically it was two small sandwiches put together. You had scramble eggs mixed with spinach and some bacon. It was ok but for the price and portion size, not worth it. Maybe I should of stuck to bagels. LOL.\\n\\nIn closing, I think next time I will just get a bagel or two and put some shmear on it.

      "text": "I cannot say enough about the service here. I was recently here for dinner with my sister while on vacation and thought I\\'d stop by here due to the amazing reviews. The restaurant was pretty packed as we entered. As we were seated, I noticed that we were not handed a menu. So we sat and waited about 15 minutes before being given a menu. We were basically left to sit in the corner for about an additional 20 minutes. I was a little confused as to why things were taking so long. I mean the reviews on Yelp were really good. The customer service I found was extremely lacking, as our order was taken the waitress walked off and had not asked us if we wanted anything to drink. So I had to ask her myself. I told her that me & my sister wanted water and she returned 5 minutes later with bottle water (which a glass of free water would have been sufficient) The food took a while to come which did not surprise me at this point. The food was good not GREAT!!! The portion was large which is probably the only reason I gave them 2 stars. After we finished our meal, we could have basically walked out of the restaurant, I doubt they would have noticed anyways with the way things were going. I walked up to the counter and stood in front of the cashier to pay my bill. She took her sweet time and didn\\'t even realize I was there until one of her co-workers pointed it out to her. From here it took her about 5 minutes to hand me my bill and change. She did not even say thank you when she gave me my change. No tip was given obviously. I would not return to this restaurant due to the poor service.",

My only guess is these idiots made my salad first, realized they made a mistake, so instead of tossing it, they placed my salad in the fridge/freezer to keep it cold. When I complained, one of the other waiters gave me a hard time (I couldn\\'t find my waitress). I had to be firm and told them to remake it. Anyway, the food was still disgusting, just like my friend\\'s food. Shut this place down, Monte Carlo. You can do better than this!",

We started with the shell fish appetizer which had a variety of samplings which were wonderful. We ordered a steak/lobster tail per couple, to be shared, for dinner. We thought that with the two sides that we ordered - mushroom risotto and brussel sprouts - we would be just full enough. When the meal arrived the lobster wasn\\'t there. We asked the waiter and he advised that they were out of lobster AT 6 IN THE EVENING!  I asked he waiter why he didn\\'t mention this before the meal arrived, as we may have changed our order. He had no answer, but apologized.\\n\\nNow, to be fair, the steak was good. Not amazing as expected, but it was fine. The sides we delicious, but we never did really rebound from our disappointment over not having lobster at a restaurant known for its seafood. The worse part is that when we left there were several people eating lobster!!!!!\\n\\nThe waiter did bring us a delicious desert, and the meal was comped by the amazing Bellagio thanks to our gambling, so I really have no reason to complain. However, word to the wise, if you are going to spend $400.00 on dinner, you may have better options on the strip.",

      "text": "We decided to host our event here with 30+ people during Thanksgiving weekend, and it\\'s unfortunate to say that we didn\\'t end up getting the wow factor that we wanted, considering the amount of $$$$ we put into this place with food, champagne and wine.\\n\\nReservation was made for 5:30pm, and though people did not show up until 6pm, latest, the server kept pouring $8 a bottle of water and $130 bottle of champagne for two hours until we complained that we waited a bit too long for the food, and for them to stop pouring champagne (glass full to the top) to people who were obviously not drinking.\\n\\nWhen the food came out, you can tell from each bite that the dishes were sitting in the kitchen for quite some time. That may have worked for their ahi tuna tar tar appetizer and salad, but it definitely didn\\'t work to their favor when it came to their entrees. The meat came out cold, looking lumpy red, and the fish came out tough and dry, even when covered with white sauce. There was also a long delay in between the plates they brought out. They also had lobster pot pie but in all honestly, I only remembered it after going through my pictures. That says a lot about the dish.\\n\\nBright side though, each cold dish still ended up being quite tasty. Similarly to the one that we frequent in Glendale, the flavors are definitely spot on. \\n\\nDeserts ended up being the main attraction because everyone commemorated on the root beer float ice cream (really?), with a side of their soft cookie (... really?).\\n\\nNow question arises whether the overall experience at this place was worth the $250 per person (including drinks), and if you\\'re telling me that the only thing people liked from this place was the DESERT, then my obvious answer is no.\\n\\nAside from the initial 2-hour delay, our main server (not any of the girls or the guy in a suit) was the only one in the restaurant who was friendly to everyone during the entire time and was also quite attentive to our needs.\\n\\nIf we had to do it all over again, we would have booked Picasso instead.",

      "text": "It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \\n\\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \\n\\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \\n\\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn\\'t do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \\\"Yes, please, another round\\\" after flagging someone down.  \\n\\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N\\'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov\\'s dog.\\n\\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \\n\\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \\\"fine.\\\"\\n\\nManagement comped one of the two Tito\\'s I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I\\'d had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \\n\\nIn all fairness, the staff at D\\'s did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn\\'t until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \\\"buyer\\'s remorse\\\").\\n\\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \\\"satisfy the customer.\\\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \\n\\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \\\"celebrity\\\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It\\'s the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :\\'(  \\n\\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril\\'s establishments. I doubt I\\'ll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I\\'ve left the building and think I\\'ll stick to D\\'s in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me. Cheers!\\n\\n[151 in 2015]",

There is usually a line if you come during lunch and dinner times because the restaurant is small and is pretty well known. They offer pretty genuine Thai Food with superb service. Every time I have been here the waitresses have been amazing. I usually sit outside in the back patio. They have heaters and the patio is enclosed so do not worry about getting too cold.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n1.) Waterfall Beef (Appetizer)- This tender beef is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. The beef is perfectly cooked: tender, juicy and clean. My favorite part of the dish in the sauce it comes with. I do not know how they make the sauce but Im guessing its a mixture of vinegar, fish sauce and heaven! haha. I wanted to pour it on everything!\\n\\n2.) Thom Kha Kai (Soup)- This lemon grass coconut soup is a must try! I can\\'t quite find the words to explain the taste but if you like sweet, tangy with a bit of spice, it\\'ll be the perfect dish for you.\\n\\n3.) Padt Thai (Noodles)- These rice noodles with stir-fried egg, green onion, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, and cilantro left me craving for more!\\n\\n4.) Drinks- Thai Tea or Singha (signature Thai beer)\\n*The owner\\'s son is pretty cool too ;P*",

      "text": "Asked front desk at Bally\\'s where to go for dinner he suggests BLT steak and tells us the chef was the last winner of Hell\\'s Kitchen which we are fans of especially Gordon I love him he reminds me of my father that died recently .  We thought we were going to have a great experience.  It started off ok.  Our bartender wasn\\'t the friendliest guy.  I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.\\n\\nIt keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn\\'t care.  She didn\\'t seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it\\'s not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don\\'t care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn\\'t care and couldn\\'t wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn\\'t care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can\\'t help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren\\'t that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn\\'t hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it\\'s a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell\\'s Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?  If  had known it was $50 for 2 scallops I never would have ordered it,  if you want to start your night off on the wrong foot and pay lots for nothing then you need to go to this place.",

However, having eaten at the Michael Mina in SF and having eaten here, I have to say the service at the SF location was far superior.  That\\'s not to say it wasn\\'t good here.  But it seemed like the staff at the SF location had just the right amount of attention - they noticed when we enjoyed a specific wine pairing more than others and made sure to offer a second glass.  Then the waiter, seeing that we were about ready to leave, actually went out and flagged a cab down for us and held it until we were all ready to walk out the door.  Similar service has happened in SF each of the 4 times I\\'ve been.\\nThis experience is what made me fall in love with the Michael Mina group of restaurants.\\n\\nHowever, it seemed like the staff at the location in Las Vegas, just weren\\'t up to that level.  We waited a good 10+ minutes before seeing someone.

The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \\n\\nBBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \\n\\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it\\'s not on the lunch menu online and I can\\'t remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn\\'t come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \\n\\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a\\'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you\\'ll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \\n\\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It\\'s pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.",

Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn\\'t the founder of the original Delmonico\\'s of New Orleans.\\n\\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico\\'s serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who\\'ve been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \\\"Commander\\'s Palace\\\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \\\"Delmonico\\'s\\\".    And that\\'s a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I\\'ve ever eaten was at the New Orleans\\' Delmonico\\'s... not the Vegas location.\\n\\nGOOD NEWS:  IT\\'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\\nBut I don\\'t think you\\'ll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it\\'s all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\\n\\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\\nHere\\'s the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\\n1) FLAVOR\\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico\\'s and I think Charlie Palmer\\'s outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina\\'s StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It\\'s probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \\n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \\n2) SERVICE\\nIf you\\'re looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it\\'s hard to beat Delmonico\\'s.  That\\'s something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer\\'s probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there\\'s rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I\\'ve consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\\n3) DÉCOR\\nIt\\'s darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I\\'ve noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I\\'m not sure this is really a big point.  \\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nDelmonico\\'s, while it\\'s lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\\n\\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\\n\\n-----------------\\nINSIDER\\'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO\\'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d\\' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You\\'ll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \\n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico\\'s in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I\\'ve pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d\\' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \\n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on \\'immediate seating\\' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu\\'s really has no such seating other than \\\"next table available\\\")",

I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.

I came here with a small group with intentions to see what Chef Errol was all about. I was very impressed with the fact he was using Food Science which is the new cutting edge trends hitting up many spots in LA and NY.\\nThe ambiance of the place is very dark, clean, and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally nice.\\nWe let Chef decide what to make for us. \\nThe drinks were very good. Made from fresh ingredients. This place also has a guiness surger! SCORE!\\nThe food is exceptional and the price is definitely reasonable.\\nI enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. Very flavorful. The salad was warm and you can really taste the dressing and the individual flavors. The lamb was phenomenal. We enjoyed the Carpaccio, LOBSTER, and tortilla espaniola which is so authentic spanish.(It wasn\\'t room temperature which is how it\\'s supposed to be served) It was warm and tasty with the herbs and potatoes. Definitely try the duck breast. - I usually like it more rare, but it was definitely delish. The dessert presentation was very classy yet cutting edge. Truffles and Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL! If you get a chance you definitely should try this out.\\nI\\'m not really too sure why there were even bad reviews. HATERS!",

There signature drinks did not have a price on the menu so we asked the waitress how much for the non-alcoholic Drake drink, she said $34, my kids decided it pretty steep and opted to pass on it, but my husband and I insisted they try it.  When the drink arrived they took a couple of sips and said it was not worth the price which made me and my husband proud, it was a great lesson in life, $34 may of been too steep for this novelty drink/restaurant but the experience was priceless.

One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality.  I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all.\\n\\nOur server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.",

I missed out on the garlic taste and my nose was running. My bad. It\\'s a delicious dish though and I\\'m sure I would have tasted flavor elevations had my tastebuds not been burned. 4/5\\n\\nSpicy Eggplant:\\nIn an attempt to eat something healthy with all the meat and carb dishes we got, we decided to get a veggie dish and add tofu instead of meat. Tasty dish with bell peppers, onion in Thai chili sauce. 3.5/5\\n\\nShort Rib Fried Rice:\\nThe best dish we tried. Tender, juicy shreds of mildly sweet short rib...sooo good. I couldn\\'t stop eating this. 5/5\\n\\nRoti:\\nNutella spread on roti topped with egg drizzled with condensed milk and dusted with powdered sugar. It\\'s sweet but not overly sweet.

The waiter returned shortly later with a pticher of water (woohoo!!) and asked if I was ready to order.\\n\\nI decided on the tonkotsu ramen with an extra side of noodles (+2) and extra nor (+1.50). There were some unconventional choices such as lobster miso, spicy miso, and buta-san. These choices were not completely unexpected considering Bachi Burger had some very inventive burger/sandwich combinations.\\n\\nThe ramen came out quickly. There were several slices of fatty pork, wood ear fungus, a sheet of nori, chopped green onion, julienned green onions (the extra negi I had ordered), and some black sesame oil (?). The pork was soft and tender, but there was a mild charred after taste to it. It wasn\\'t terrible, just unexpected. The broth was good: not too salty, rich, but not very flavorful. In short, the broth just really didn\\'t make a huge impression on me. The noodles were just a touch harder than I prefer. I was checked on frequently and my table cleared quickly\\n\\nMy total bill for the bowl of tonkotsu ramen, extra noodles, extra negi with tax and tip was $15, a little pricey. Overall, Shoku is a good addition to the Vegas ramen scene, service was friendly and quick. The distance/location of the shop along with the somewhat poor value makes me think twice about making a trip just to try the other types of ramen.",

      "text": "We came here on a Wednesday night for a quick bite to eat prior to watching a movie. We\\'d pass by this place many times on our way to the gym, so I was excited to try it! When we first walked in, I noticed how clean the place was. The bathroom was nice and the toilet paper was thick and soft, which is surprising for a fast food type place. Furthermore, the service was good except the guy who was handling our order was in a rush and made our order wrong... But it\\'s okay. The dinner rush can be rough when there\\'s a lot of people coming by for dinner! \\n\\nFOOD: Imagine a Chipotle style food bar where you tell the associate what you\\'d like. I had the falafal bowl and my husband has the steak bowl. The food was okay. The falafal was cripsy. I added the hummus in my bowl, which was tasty. BEWARE - the green mild sauce is pretty spicy! The red hot sauce just taste hot and lacks flavor. The steak lacked taste. I believe there are better Mediterranean places around town to try with better food and service. \\nIf you check-in, you get a free dessert. They baklava was small. We got the almond one, which was okay. \\n\\nPRICE: For our two bowls and the free dessert it was around $20, which is fair. The portions was pretty big and I had to take half of it home so it was great value. \\n\\nOverall, I give it a 3-star since everything was okay. I probably would not come back though. \\n\\nHappy Dining, \\n\\nJT",

Our \\\"server\\\" Jennilee informs us - in the most condescending tone I have EVER heard that we were 7 minutes too late to use the coupon.  Well we had been sitting at the table and she had ignored us while flirting with some guy at the bar.    She then informs us that she saw us walk in and it didn\\'t matter we were too late and the \\\"system\\\" wouldn\\'t allow the sale.   Well our money spends just as well in a different establishment.  I was ready to leave.   My partner likes the beer selection and after working all day it was time to eat.   Jennilee then disappears after taking our order.  Never asks if we need anything, if we needed more drinks, are we still breathing.   Now the place was not busy.   There was 1 other table, 3 guys at the bar and a few people playing pool.  Jennilee stood at the bar flipping her hair and flirting with a guy.    Total disappointment.   Utter lack of customer service.   The personality of a dead bird.   It\\'ll be a long looonnnggg time before I consider going back.",

      "text": "This is the first time I have been back to Shoku Ramen since since Bachi Burger decided to merge their two spaces.  I loved the food at Bachi, but stopped going there because the wait was ridiculous, the service was really bad, and they were pretentious.  \\n\\nMerging the spaces and redecorating did not speed up the wait time, but we were able to get some counter space way quicker than waiting for a table.  The service was still crappy.  We got flat $3 Diet Cokes and the waitress did not seem to think flat soda was an issue.  And even though we did not drink them, we still had to pay for them.\\n\\nI ordered the 5 spice Shoyu Ramen for $10.  This sounded interesting to me because I have never heard of ramen with chicken.  I assume it\\'s not traditional, since I have never seen it at any noodle house, but it was very good.  It was a shoyu broth with free-range chicken breast, wavy noodles, bok choy, green onion, mushroom, and fish cakes.  The broth was not too salty, but it needed a little kick so I added chili strands and chili spice.  The chicken had skin, but was very good once I removed it.  \\n\\nAll in all, if I had to go back to Shoku, I would likely order a burger from the Bachi menu, but I would order this again if I was in a soup mood; even though it is overpriced for ramen.",

Second course was the bowl of soup that tasted like progresso, then the hummus platter that was ok. Then the steak skewers that weren\\'t bad but again not anything great. Lastly the chicken & cous cous. This isn\\'t Moroccan food. \\n\\nThe other strange thing was the belly dancer was Asian, aren\\'t we at a Moroccan restaurant? Don\\'t get me wrong, she was good. \\n\\nFor 4 people to dine, with the $65 off for the groupon it still was $102. I\\'m sorry but it definitely was not worth it. Way better Mediterranean food at Paymons. Lastly the service was lacking, I sat for 20 minutes with an empty water glass, and the place was not busy.

The dishes we ordered were waterfall beef, spicy eggplant with shrimp, and chicken pad Thai. The presentation of each dish was incredible and the tastes were even better. The waterfall beef was served with sticky rice which I\\'m not a fan of, but I ended up enjoying it. I had a taste of the pad Thai,it had all the flavors a pad Thai should have.

The second star was for the service. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Here is why I don\\'t particularly care for this buffet: This place was WAY overpriced. $30 per person for dinner. That price would be acceptable had the food been fresh, warm, tasty, and cooked well. The coffee was awful. It tasted like mildew. \\nThe Only good food item I ate was the caramel cheesecake. The Cesar salad was tasteless and nearly dry. The lasagna was dry as well. It tasted like a freezer burn lasagna that you pull out to eat for dinner as a last resort. \\nThe mashed potatoes were good, but how hard is it to make good mashed potatoes?? The shrimp was pretty fresh and clean as well. One of the biggest upsets was the fried chicken; just gross. \\nAll in all, I would Not recommend eating here and we won\\'t be returning. Bummer!",

We arrived a little late and they only offer the menu within a short hour between 5-6pm i believe. However the waiter was nice enough to offer the menu anyway. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nice and clean in the restaurant. I had my doubts walking into this place because it was located next to the arboretum at the Bellagio and it was particularly busy that evening.  But the sound from the crowd was nicely muted within the restaurant, I hardly notice all the passerby outside as soon as we sat down. \\n\\nthe menu was great. My brother opted in for the tuna tartare. The waiter mixes the ingredients right infront of you and the dish was fresh and the flavors were vibrant. I opted for their pumpkin soup and grill cheese sandwich. I don\\'t remember what the cheese was but that sandwich was delicious... It was down right magical. The soup was creamy and the flavors were strong. Some might not like it as much if they don\\'t like pumpkin but it sat well with me.\\n\\nSecond course I opted for their lobster pot pie. It was $20 extra I believe but it was totally worth it. They stuck a whole lobster in the pot and baked in its own juices and veggies. The lobster has got to be a good 3lb. I was stuffed from this. The other people in my party got the filet. I can\\'t comment on that dish because I didn\\'t try it. But it did look delicious and my friend said it melted in his mouth. So I\\'m going to assume its good.\\n\\nThe dessert was either the rootbeer float or the chocolate truffle. Both were good. The float had a little waffer straw which was a nice touch. The chocolate was intense but with a very nice texture. \\n\\nthe service was good all around. I am wonderfully surprised with this restaurant. I would not mind returning and trying the Chef\\'s menu next time.",

      "text": "Let me first say that BBQ is a varied and wondrous thing.  There are as many different versions and variants as there are pit masters and pigs. Some folks like it spicy while others prefer it sweet.  Some like it soaked in sauce and others like it dry.  Some like it heavily smoked while other folks prefer just hints of wood. There really is no single requirement or standard.  This is why running a BBQ joint can be a tough gig. You know you\\'re just not going to be able to make it great - for everybody.  At its core however, BBQ is ultimately a choreography of wood, fire, and meat that, when properly executed, is a thing of beauty.  To do this at home is one thing, but to do it in a restaurant-based production line is something completely different. It is a business and an art many fail at. \\n\\nI had heard so much about RS over the years I was very excited to find their new facility in Summerlin.  As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the Strip unless all other dining options (including the neighbor\\'s cat) have been exhausted.  Okay...that was a joke...I love cats... and I would have to catch it.  Anyway, when the new RS opened near me, I made it a point to drop by.  With almost 2000 four and five star reviews, I went with very high  expectations - maybe too high. \\n\\nI ordered two of their five meat plates to go. Each plate came with three small sides, so I upgraded them to larges and figured I would have ample food to feed six. The service was courteous and fast, so when I headed out the door with two heavy bags in tow I was giddy about the impending feast.  That story changed somewhat when I got home and uncrated the grub. \\n\\nThe first thing that struck us was the size (or lack thereof) of the side portions.  We opened up the large side containers to find them only 3/4 (or less) full.  When we opened up the cornbread boxes (I purchased 3 orders) we were also disappointed to find 6 tiny (I mean tiny) squares. I remember my wife joking that they had clearly mixed up their cornbread with their croutons.  By the time the sides were distributed we each had about a tablespoon or two of each one. \\n\\nRANT FOLLOWS: C\\'mon guys - you\\'re not on The Strip feeding a bunch of hungover tourists who will never return.  You are in Summerlin  feeding your hard working fellow locals - and we want a manly piece of cornbread and grown up side servings!  I paid over 80 bucks for my order and, for that price, I should be granted a full container of beans!! We are your desert brothers and sisters...we come to you because we are hungry...feed us! Okay, I feel better... sorry. \\n\\nUnlike the sides, the meat portions were ample. The chicken was outstanding.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked, and fall off the bone tender. Great bird guys!  The hot links were tasty as well, as were the ribs.  I wouldn\\'t change a thing on either. \\n\\nThe brisket and pork, however, were disappointing to say the least. The brisket we received was so chewy it required a sharp knife (a brisket no no), and the pork was something else entirely.  I have had pulled pork, chopped pork, chunked pork, pork loin, pork butt, and pork chops but what we received was a pile of what can best be described as \\\"pork hash.\\\"  It was almost minced.  When I tasted it, it became clear why they had done this. It was full of fat.  That also explained the oozing pool of grease it floated on.  It had a great flavor though - I can\\'t wait to go back and try the actual meat. \\n\\nFinally, on a positive note, the sauces were a home run.  Our favorites were the mustard and vinegar selections. Just like back home, and even a bit better.  You could pour this stuff on a rock and make it edible.  Great sauces guys! Best I have had in town - by far. \\n\\nBottom line here is that RS makes some tasty stuff; tasty enough to bring us back for a second try in a month or two.  In the meantime, my hope is that they get their heads off \\\"The Strip\\\" and start feeding their fellow desert brethren like we deserve.  I will even give them a pass on the brisket and greasy fatty pork, because their sauce is so good it even made them edible.  And the collard greens....did I mention the collard greens? Pure Southern  perfection.",

Moreover, the following dish, the tofu with mushrooms and risotto was extremely greasy and salted to which my sensitive stomach did not react well. \\nAs I only eat out I have certainly tried plenty of different restaurants and must say that Michael Mina\\'s one is without a doubt the most disappointing one. I would most defintely advise against it.",

I couldn\\'t wait to go back but, I was there over Thanksgiving weekend 3 days ago, and got FROZEN crab legs YUCK !!  No STEAK ,  Hand breaded shrimp that was decent, but the breading was falling off and very doughy.  This is Vegas and they obviously are trying to cut costs, how hard is it to boil Crab legs.  The Prime Rib was terrible, a rubber SHOE at best !  The server gave me a piece with blood all over it, should not of been served in the first place and the Server cutting the beef new it as she was starring at me when I walked down to my demise, I went back 5 minutes later to get another piece in hopes of a better cut and it was freaking terrible, looked like rubber and was very dull, no taste.  Out of the group of 7 we were all disappointed, ALL !!  The fruit selection was nothing great, salads average and the dessert was ok if you like Lemon Cheesecake, nothing to scream about.  The wait staff though was good at getting plates and drinks which is why it got 2 stars.  The Lobster Ravioli was so processed and phony, looked good tasted blah,  There was not 1 item I liked or really enjoyed.",

He is super friendly and helpful and he made the best margaritas for my husband\\'s birthday and they have a beer on tap called El Jeffe and it is a beer with chile flavor steeped in. Really different and good.  The chef does specials for Monday night football and we were there for Chicago vs Minnesota so we each had one of the specials. Chicago was a loose take on the Chicago dog- bacon wrapped hot dogs with pico de gallo and cotija cheese, it was really good and a new hot dog flavor for me. The Minnesota special was a juicy lucy and it was amazing. For great food and service come to Herringbone for sure!",

We tried everything - ham, prime rib, incredible ravioli, made-to-order eggs, great sausage gravy, some unnameable weird salad...the selection was endless and much better than any of the other buffets around the MGM, especially Mandalay Bay .

So after turning 21, I never really even put the effort into a night out on the strip because I imagined drunk girls, over crowded clubs, and \\'The Hangover\\' style hijinx.\\n\\nWhilst in-town for a Vegas wedding, my friends and I headed over to Beer Park, which my sister had found on Yelp. What a pleasant surprise! The bar was not too crowded and the atmosphere rocked! We had a full view of the strip and the DJ (Bayami) was playing the best set. We had such a fun time with our beer flights and playing oversized jenga that, get this, we came back the next day! Beer Park is all out fun atmosphere food and drinks! Stop here on your next Vegas trip for some fun that has nothing to do with the club scene!\\ninstagram: @glowrae",

Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \\\"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\\\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \\\"let somebody know\\\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.",

      "text": "I work up the street from Sin City Thai, so when it opened up I was excited to have another potential lunch spot. I finally got around to trying them for lunch on Valentine\\'s Day with the lovely Jaime W. as my dining date. \\n\\nWe started out with delicious hibiscus lemonades. Very refreshing, definitely something I would try again. We also shared a chicken satay appetizer. It was good, but not great.\\n\\nFor my meal, I went with the Mixed Vegetable lunch special which is a good deal at $6.95. The menu does not give a description of the dish, I assumed I would get an assortment of veggies like corn, mushrooms and broccoli. Instead I got onions and peppers in assorted colors. I was rather disappointed by this. \\n\\nI decided to go back and get some takeout before posting a review. This time I went with the Orange Chicken lunch special. I did not call in my order, but they still had me on my way in about 15 minutes. I liked this dish better then the Mixed Vegetable dish, but it still didn\\'t blow me away and I doubt I\\'d order it again. \\n\\nService each time was efficient and friendly, and since I work really close I will probably go back at some point to try the Pad Thai. Hopefully after that I can update and add another star but until then, Sin City Thai is just alright to me, nothing special.",

The French toast is the bomb....only order the 4 slices. ..portion is very large,and best I\\'ve ever eaten world wide. They serve more pancakes than french toast. The selection of eggs Benedict is large,at least 4 different selections. Irish eggs Benedict is corned beef hash ...one of my favorites, German eggs Benedict is potato pancakes on English muffin and topped with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. 5 stars*****. Cakes and pie and made all day and night long. Always fresh.  Death by dessert  without a doubt. Service is super except Saturday and Sunday mornings between 11-2. Seems like all the church goers head right there. Very similar to New York diners. Been to all 3 locations, this one is a little better.",

      "text": "My husband  and I came here on our first date, some years ago, but we went to the Summerlin location where there was an hour long wait, and ended up here. I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait. \\n\\nThe service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd\\'s pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn\\'t seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband\\'s dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish. \\n\\nFor both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria\\'s Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops. Newly expanded stores include: Swatch, Tommy Bahama, Harry Winston, and Anthropologie. It might be confusing to some people how the different levels are, but just ask someone to point you in the right direction.",

I use to come here all the time when I was in Vegas for their champaign brunch on Saturday or Sunday, but over the last two years this place has gone downhill.

Not sure how they managed to pull that off, I guess they want to be consistent at having gross food all the way across the board.\\n\\nIt\\'s looks like they have a wide selection of food here but after walking through you realize it\\'s the same lame food on both sides. The only thing decent about this place is their servers are usually good with following up on you, but all they do is refill the soda like any other server at a buffet is suppose to do so who really gives a sh1t about that.

I came here specifically expecting craft beers and a lot of them, but the selection was smaller than my dreams and the ads set me up for. \\n\\nI love craft beer and I want to feel like I\\'m getting something special at a decent craft beer price and atmosphere. It\\'s a tad steep here. Totally a tourist trap as others suggested. Viva Las Vegas! That being said, the atmosphere is great and delivers. Wonderful view and arrangement and lots of tvs. \\n\\nOh, the beer isn\\'t bad. Mmmm. Very good actually. I found quite a few beers I thoroughly enjoyed and could probably find more, but maybe not at these prices. I felt bad for all the guys getting Budlights. But that was kind of confusing and entertaining anyway. \\n\\nI\\'ve come back because it\\'s a great place to take visiting and novice family and friends or a big and generous group to watch the game in style. Beers on tap, chile verde nachos and brats are totally our language and the other half of why I\\'d return. Great beer and food. \\n\\nSo I suggest to come here when in the mood to be touristy and splurge, because all women foodies get this urge, don\\'t we?",

So convenient!  \\n\\nMost of our table had the signature tasting menu and two guests had the seasonal tasting menu.  If I had the option, I would\\'ve done some mixing and matching to get the best of both worlds.  \\n\\nThe first course of caviar was excellent.  I wished that was bigger.  I could easily have eaten a whole plate.  \\n\\nThe tuna tartare was a tad heavy on the sesame oil, but otherwise, the tuna itself was perfect.  I shared with my friend and got to try her hamachi.  That was incredible. \\n\\nMy miso glazed sea bass was amazing.  The texture was spot on.  The portion was just right and the flavours were well balanced.  \\n\\nWhat do you think of lobster pot pie?  Sounds like a good one, right?  The lobster was way overcooked.  It was actually a huge disappointment.  None of us wanted to say anything because we didn\\'t want another portion and we were getting full anyways, but this one was off the mark.  The carrots were undercooked.  Very strange dish.  \\n\\nThe wagyu steak was good.  Not fantastic, not terrible, just good.  The truffle was a nice addition but I felt the foie gras was unnecessary.  Of course, that might\\'ve been because we had just consumed the whole roasted foie gras served table side.  That was really good.  I preferred the middle pieces whereas some of our table enjoyed the end pieces.  Chacun son gout!  \\n\\nI liked the mini root beer float, but I\\'m a sucker for root beer.  The cookies were nice and moist.  The chocolate bar was very rich after such a filling meal, I wish I ate it all but just didn\\'t have room.  I tried my friend\\'s panna cotta and that was light and delicate.  Very smooth on the palate.  Passion fruit and avocado, go figure!  \\n\\nOverall, considering quality, quantity, and value, this was a good meal.  \\n\\nThe lobster threw me off (it threw us all off).",

It\\'s totally right up our alley - great craft beer selection, great food, awesome view, dope music, and family friendly! Located right in front of the Paris Hotel, with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Our kiddo enjoyed the games provided and the Bruno Mars/JT playlist, he sure loves to dance! It was about 95 degrees out that evening but the misters, fans and ice cold beers made it feel very pleasant up there. Beers were on the pricey side but that\\'s to be expected of the location. No complaints there. We ordered the Loaded Tots, although it could have been more \\\"loaded\\\". I had to ask for an extra side of beer cheese and bacon. That was probably the only negative of the night but the service, delicious cold brews and great vibes made up for it. We also ordered the crinkle cut fries for our tot and he was all about them. Good fries + lots of games = happy kid. Happy kid = HAPPY MOMMA AND DADDY! =)\\n\\nWhen we arrived for our reservation, the hostess initially told us that children weren\\'t allowed that night because there would be a DJ playing that evening and the cut-off time was 8pm. Any other time would have been fine. I totally understood, and kindly just said I had wished we were informed that when I made the reservation. Before walking away, the hostess tells me, \\\"You know what, hold on. Let me talk to my manager and see what we could do.\\\" A few moments later she returns and tells us the manager said it would be fine to bring in my tot, as long as we could be done by 11pm. Perfect! We were done around 10:30pm. I was so appreciative that she took the time to ask her manager, rather than just sending us away. Now that\\'s great customer service. I can\\'t remember her name...Kailani perhaps?.. but a big thank you to her. She was such a friendly hostess. The service for the rest of the evening was superb as well. We are definitely hitting up Beer Park every time we visit Las Vegas! \\n\\nConveniently located right below Beer Park was HEXX Chocolate & Confexxions. Uhm..YUM! Perfect spot to grab some dessert afterward (or before!). Our tot enjoyed running amuck in there. It was a perfect ending to a perfect family fun Friday night!",

We starting timing the waitress on our phones to see how long it was going to take her to get our order...10 minutes and a solid minute before we were going to leave. After that we waited another 10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered, well some of us that is. Me and two other friends ordered coffee and after waiting twenty minutes to see her start to walk over with it we all realized there was not enough in the pot for all of us. So my friend waited another 10 minutes before he actually got his coffee. My friend and I that did get coffee originally were already done with our coffee when he finally got some....uuggghhh!! Our friends that ordered soda both complained that something didn\\'t taste right and switched too water. AND that was just the drinks:( \\n\\nNow the food is the only part of this review that i gave stars to. Not for it\\'s promptness or fantastical value because it had neither but for the fact that it was hot and filled up my alcohol laden belly as wished.

When we were sitting there wondering if we would ever get our food or coffee for the lone one of  us that still hadn\\'t gotten any they were gone and fed!!!! What a crappy experience at a normally very good place...disappointed that i brought my friends there for their first time and our waitress sucked!!!

I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \\n\\nWe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \\n\\nThe service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don\\'t remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \\n\\nVery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo\\'s craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \\n\\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don\\'t eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \\n\\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \\n\\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \\n\\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn\\'t doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.",

On Spring Mountain, there\\'s probably like a billion Pho places to try, but I think this was the one my parents recommended me when I moved to Vegas.\\n\\nThe moment I walked in, a Nujabes song was playing and I thought to myself, \\\"HOLY CRAP, THIS IS AWESOME!\\\" Then I was greeted by a woman who worked there that was sitting on the side talking with her friends. The moment I spoke in Vietnamese, hospitality increased by 10 times. They started to talk to me asking me what I\\'m doing in Vegas and why my Vietnamese was good. (I personally think I\\'m not that great...)\\n\\nThe interior looked pretty decent and clean and I ended up talking with the owners for a little bit more. In the end, they invited me to their friend\\'s spa that\\'s having a potluck and said it would be a good opportunity to meet more Vietnamese people. (I felt like it was also a sales pitch, but I\\'m a bit of a loner since I moved here.)\\n\\nWell anyway, I ended up ordering Pho Dac Biet to go. When I got home it looked like the standard Pho. Bloody meat, Bo Vien, basil, lime, you know the usual! The moment I tasted it I realized the difference compared to the other Pho places. The broth didn\\'t give off this unusually sweet taste that the others use which is a huge plus to me. Even the tripe was easy to eat and not hard like some places.\\n\\nThis place deserves the 4 stars, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of that incredibly sweet broth, go elsewhere, but to me, this is perfect.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll come back when I don\\'t feel like cooking at home. :]\\n\\n\\nPro tip: Learn Vietnamese, your score on the service will increase.",

I was amazed how nice the restaurant was and semi quiet especially since its located at the Bellagio Conservatory. You cant even hear the big crowds outside. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. \\n\\nI decided on the Cookbook Tasting Menu and my BF got the Far Niente Menu (which changes seasonal).\\n\\nCookbook Tasting Menu ($108 per person):\\n\\n1. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love Ahi Tuna so I am biased but the tuna was really fresh and tasty.\\n\\n2. Mini Maine Lobster Pot Pie - MY FAVORITE. I wish I got the BIGGER lobster pot pie but its okay. The crust wasnt oily and there were plenty of potatoes and spinach. i would definitely order this again. \\n\\n3. Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Shellfish dumpling - My least fav because I am not a fish person. The sea bass wasnt kinda salty but definitely loved the broth.  \\n\\n4. Loire American Kobe Ribeye with Foie Gras - Definitely a new taste for me. I enjoyed the Kobe ribeye and it was cook medium rare. It was my first time trying foie gras and its something i have to get use too. I really liked the potato cake though. YUM! \\n\\n5. Tasting dessert menu - Man, by the time dessert came i didnt even want to look at food. but i loved the root beer float and the warm chocolate cookies. \\n\\nI would definitely come here again. I am so glad my BF took me to Michael Mina. It was a perfect ending for our trip. I recommend ordering their tasting menus for first timers like myself because if i ever come back i am going to order from their entree or ala cart menu.",

Thought the seafood pasta dish was excellent with the right amount of zing to its tasty sauce and ample fish, shrimp, etc.  The sea bass on the other hand was a disaster.  It was very dry presumably because it was grossly overcooked, and lacked flavor.   Rib eye steak was tasty but a step down from a real quality steak house.  Tried some appetizers including the salmon cold dish, and was not at all impressed with the chefs attempt to turn the salmon into something special ( I consider myself a sushi connoisseur ).   Had a Mac n cheese side dish and was somewhat surprised to find small bits of pineapple floating throughout.  In my opinion the pineapple was not a pleasant surprise and simply detracted from a dish that I consider rich comfort food.  In retrospect I should have sent the sea bass back, but felt my doing so would impact our guests who were here from Korea.",

But my experience wouldn\\'t bring me back. There were 2 or 3 other people in the restaurant, and while we were eating, a few groups came in, sat down and left without eating. I have no idea why.\\n\\nWe started off with miso soup. My girlfriend was fond of it, as for me it tasted a bit runny and a little on the downside of flavor, but it was the right temperature and it was just ok. The sushi was fair and like i said, the crunch roll was tasty and had to be the best roll that lunch. They do not have half orders, I prefer half orders because if there were to be a roll i did not like, there would be a small portion to finish, and also half orders get you to try all of the different kinds of sushi they have to offer. So this place is better for groups.\\n\\nService was definitely fast, the lady who served us was nice and friendly but she seemed rushed in a way that you would see as if you were late to class.

In fact, we liked their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost every day we stayed there. \\n\\nI am giving a 4 star for their location, and for $ value with respect to their overall food quality and services.  Would recommend for families and individuals on budget / biz trip.",

I definitely recommend making reservations if you\\'re going around 7-9pm and want to sit in their cozy booths that make you feel like you\\'re inside a wooden barrel. They had a variety of choices on the menu to choose from. From sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked items. You can either do a la carte or pick from a 10 course dinner [$29.99] or 12 course dinner [$39.99] . As well as ayce for $80 which is steep or they had some other cheaper sets as well. The boyfriend and I chose to both do the 12 course. They bring out a piece of paper and for each course you get to choose which item you want from their list. I chose garlic edamame, hamachi w/jalapeño, agedashi tofu, oysters [4 on the halfshell], soba salad with salmon skin [there were soba noodles in it! Pretty interesting], salmon bowl, tempura mix [shrimp and veggies], salmon teriyaki, sukiyaki [noodles, sliced beef, tofu, veggies in hot sweet broth], blue diamond roll, miso soup, and to finish off I had condensed milk shaved ice. I\\'d definitely recommend this place for someone who\\'s looking for something different. Only thing I\\'d change is the wait time on food.. After half way through we both got over waiting for another item to come but I see why they do that so you have time to enjoy your current dish. Everything was good and we definitely had stuff leftover to take home!",

If you\\'re feeling hungry, I feel bad for ya son...because it won\\'t be a cheap lunch.\\n\\nWas the bowl good? Eh, it was alright. The flavors were decent, and everything tasted fairly fresh. But all it really is, is a salad with a few toppings on it. Certainly not worth nearly $10. Add on crappy service with rude employees, I\\'ll pass on Parsley.",

There was nothing I couldn\\'t finish, but I have had a better version of each at other restaurants. The sushi had an odd texture when I tried it and was my least favorite of the specials, and I feel like it was a bit \\\"fishier\\\" than comparable sushi joints in the area. The tonkatsu bento was my favorite, with everything crispy and flavorful, and I love the miso that comes with their lunch specials. (It comes with what I can only describe as a \\\"seaweed medly\\\" and the different textures are quite pleasant. The food looks absolutely gorgeous, and the portions are just the right size, however the taste just wasn\\'t the most memorable for me. My co-workers love the place, though, so maybe I just haven\\'t hit the right menu item. I will probably be back, and definitely update the review with another star if I find a favorite.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little odd. It strikes me as sort of \\\"west elm\\\" catalog, which isn\\'t bad, just unexpected from a thai/japanese place, and really, a restaurant in general for me, and the jazz soundtrack reminds me a bit of Richard Cheese songs. That being said, it\\'s very cozy, with nice, squishy chairs, and I felt quite comfortable and welcomed. \\n\\nThe wait staff is awesome, and put up with my fussy co-worker admirably, and even let me know about their free-thai tea with yelp check in. The price is right for lunch at around $10/person, but for me, the food wasn\\'t enough to take it from \\\"A-OK\\\" to \\\"Yay!\\\".",

This place is always busy for lunch, so that\\'s a pretty good sign the food is good.\\n\\nTheir menu was big, with lots of sandwiches, po\\'boy subs, paninins, BIG (I mean like almost foot long big) baked potatoes, soups, wraps, pasta, and even a full service salad bar with all the fixins\\'.  I had never been there before so I asked what suggestions they had.  The order taker told me to try the \\'New York Yankee\\'.  It is a sandwich made with pastrami and corned beef on rye bread, with Swiss cheese and mustard.  It also came with chips and a pickle.  It was a great first choice, this bad boy was huge!  The sandwich itself was like 6 inches in height.  The pastrami and corned beef were moist and flavorful, and went great with the Swiss and rye.  Not half bad for only $7.99.\\n\\nTheir sweet tea is pretty bomb too, almost as good as Raising Cane\\'s.  Cane\\'s is better mainly because of their pellet-shaped ice.  Their salad bar is nothing to laugh at either.  Lots of fresh choices, and even whole hard-boiled eggs which were great (unlike Sweet Tomatoes where they shred it up).  They even have free Garlic Toast and mini muffins, as well as various crackers that are complimentary to all patrons.  Not just that...but they also have free soft serve ice cream!  Well, free if you buy something to eat.  On second thought, I never asked if ice cream came with everything on the menu.  I kinda just helped myself to the machine everytime I ate there.  Nonetheless, I never got busted for it.  So.....therefore, it must be free!\\n\\nNot a bad place to have a great lunch with a bunch of your friends.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I went there recently for dinner and found out the portions aren\\'t quite what they used to be.  It was rather slow with no one in there.  Instead of my 6 inch high sandwich, this time is was maybe an inch shorter.  Boo.  This time the soft serve ice cream machine was broken too.  Double Boo.  So stick to this place for lunch, with busier crowds they tend to do better food.",

I liked that they had whole asian pears\\n\\nFood was very hit or miss.  I would have expected much better quality for the price.  Steamed dim sum dumplings were cold and dried out. Miso soup was devoid of tofu and sooo salty.  Chinese \\'rice balls\\' were awfully dried out and sitting in a thick sauce that was so salty that I could not eat it.  I am the sort of person who has 3-4 different types of specialty salt at home and sometimes even carries my sea salt grinder in my purse, so it is really bad if something is that salty to me! Fried tofu balls were better, lighter and fluffier than any fried tofu that I have previously had elsewhere.  Sesame balls were hot enough for the sesame seeds to be all hot and toasty - yum :)\\n\\nDesserts selection was pretty decent.  All of the desserts (fruit tarts, custards, etc) that I tried were delicious, though still not quite worth the price...\\n\\nMy favorite part was the asian pear.  My husband does not remember eating anything impressive, but is still grumping about the cost.  My oldest son loved the mints that he got as we were leaving.\\n\\nAll in all, not worth the $$.

They are decent pickles with a good crunch. Just imagine if every sandwich you ate in your lifetime came with unlimited pickles, how many per sandwich would you eat? I downed 7 of them with my $6.99 Papa Joe. The sandwich was turkey with roma tomato and pesto aioli and was good, despite being small as it was shoved onto a square of Herb Foccica bread about toilet paper size. There are places with better turkey around, so unless you love pickles, this chain will only be necessary when in a bind. Salad bar is good too on a previous visit, but just throw some chicken or protein on the thing and stop nicle and diming us for everything up there (pickles was just a start).",

I think this is ridiculous when the restaurant was not that busy.  I then asked if we could sit down and have a few drinks before we ordered.  She looked around and said no.  This place will not be in business for long treating customers like this.  She told me the kitchen was backed up.  In these tough economic times, customer service should be priority one!!!!",

Needless to say, we were all very unimpressed by the selection of food here. It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did 1 dish. I wasn\\'t motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn\\'t make up for the meal.\\n\\nI had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You\\'d need several to feel like you\\'re eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn\\'t expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?\\n\\nNothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them. Next time I\\'m in town I\\'ll play it safe and come for lunch if things seem different.\\n\\nActually, no. I\\'m going back to Bacchanal.",

So of course I had to eat at the factory! \\n\\nI went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn\\'t judging the food at that age. \\n\\nMy husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn\\'t take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter??? \\n\\nWe ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well. \\n\\nAnd for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose. \\n\\nAll in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it! \\n\\nIf I could change one thing, I would have them start taking reservations! \\n\\nI will be back for many years to come! Enjoy all!",

Got our drinks, beer and wine. Then he explained everything on the menu plus informed us that there would be a lot of food. We ordered the black bean salmon, spring rolls, pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, 5 spice soup, veggie & mushroom, steamed rice, crispy noodles with shrimp chow mein.

We were seated promptly and the restaurant was almost full. It took about 10 mins before a wait staffer appeared but once he did he provided us excellent service, I watched as he was extremely busy, always on the move and never wasting a minute standing around as I noticed a couple of the other waiters doing. We started with the Mochiko chicken appetizer, it was very good with a slight crunch and mildly sweet garlicky flavor. Next was the Pork Belly bao which was delicious in a super soft bun and finally  I had the chilled vermicelli noodle bowl which was good as I find most of the grilled pork in these types of noodle bowls either not \\\"grilled\\\" or  too sweet, the pork was grilled and had a mild sweetness to it, the only thing lacking in this entree that kept it from being perfect was the fish sauce flavor, it had none that I could detect in the nuoc cham sauce. My partner had the wonton soup and found it to be good but not memorable and could have used a few more wontons in it as it only had 3. It was not a dish he would order again.",

Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don\\'t worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass.\\n\\nOverall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn\\'t all that exciting anyway.",

      "text": "For a special treat we tried Michael Mina.  We surprisingly were able to get reservations the same afternoon at 5:00 pm when it opened.  We were immediately seated by a window seat that we had requested.\\n\\nAtmosphere is nice, service was very good to excellent. Waiter was friendly and reassured us that he would try to have us out in time to attend a show. When I asked what was a particular garnish, he went and re-checked with the kitchen to be sure.  \\n\\nWe had the three course pre-theater menu ($68).  Both my friend and I were looking forward to the butternut squash soup that was on the menu (as well as on line).  Unfortunately, the waiter did not mention that they did not have it until we were ordering.  We had the alternative soup that was not listed which was a celery heart soup with a small crab cake in the center of the soup.  It didn\\'t  sound as appealing to me but it was excellent!  Presentation of the soup was very nice with two waiters pouring the soup at the table from two small individual containers.  I would order it again!\\n\\nI had the fresh sour dough bread .  My friend and I were surprised that there was not a glutton free alternative.  Something else small should have been offered to my friend to nibble on, especially as I was eating my bread and she just sat there waiting for the soup to arrive.  I was surprised that the bread waiter did not come back to offer a second bread or replenish the butter.\\n\\nWe both ordered the sea bass.  My friend loved her dish!   I often cook broiled sea bass so I was surprised that the sea bass came in a light Asian broth sort of like steamed Chinese fish but much better (my mistake for not reading the menu more closely). The portion of sea bass was plentiful.  There were Chinese dried black mushroom slices, Bok Choy and a tiny won ton dumpling in the broth.  The sea bass was placed upon a bed of slivered jicama.   Won ton  wrapper was sort of undercooked and the filling needed more flavoring.  Broth was flavorful.  Sea bass was tender and seasoning on top was tasty.  Bok Choy was slightly over cooked to my liking ( I eat a lot of Asian food!). . Slice of black mushroom was salty but this might have been a sprinkling of seasoning intended for the fish.  Overall the dish was a blend of salty and mostly mild tastes\\n\\nDessert was excellent!! I had the rootbeer float with chocolate pecan cookies.  Sooo good!  Cookies were warm, crispy outside with soft middle.   Root beer was well balanced with the delicious ice cream.   My friend had the vanilla Ice cream.  (Since she is glutton free she replaced  a tart with 2nd scoop of ice cream). Ice cream was refreshing with a clean vanilla flavor.\\n\\nWe were celebrating my friend\\'s birthday so they brought out a plate with \\\"happy birthday\\\" written on it, a candle and four small chocolate balls.   Very nice touch!  \\n\\nBest not to rush this type of dining experience.  Be sure to allow yourself at least two hours to enjoy the meal in a leisurely fashion.  (Our mistake!)\\n\\nOverall, very nice experience!!",

      "text": "Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I\\'ve had nor without flaws.\\n\\nThe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn\\'t a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I\\'d say the food part of Emeril\\'s more or less did the trick with regards to that.\\n\\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre\\'d was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn\\'t feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre\\'d didn\\'t really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \\n\\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn\\'t fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to rip Delmonico\\'s so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn\\'t deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \\\"double-baked potato\\\" + \\\"Asparagus\\\" was fantastic.\\n\\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I\\'ve had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar\\'s Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\\n\\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \\n\\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.",

Rice bowls sound so simple, but they\\'re comforting, fresh, and hit just the right spot when done well.\\n\\nMenu has about five different bowls, each with their own protein and complementary sauces, all with rice and veggies. The Mochiko Chicken Bowl is the only one I\\'ve tried so far and it was great- generous portion of fresh, juicy chicken with a great sauce, crisp veggies, and a scoop of rice. So long as you go in knowing it\\'s mochiko influenced and not some strictly-authentic version of the dish, you should enjoy it. There are a few sides available, one being a salad with a choice of three house-made dressings (black sesame vin was my favorite.) \\n\\nOwner and Chef Tony is a treasure- I accidentally came just after close, but he opened up, let me in, and made my tasty dinner. He\\'s charming and chatty and has some great plans for this place. I\\'ll be coming back to try their Shrimp Bayou and porkbelly bowls soon!",

The seaweed was a bit soggier than I would have liked but not bad.  My friend and I thought that the rice could have been slightly longer tho.

      "text": "One thing I miss about living in San Francisco is having take out options that go beyond pizza and Chinese food. Every now and then I am just looking for a take out treat that is just a little bit lighter. So I was really excited when I stumbled upon Taiga, and was hoping to add it to my list of options. \\n\\nLocated across from one of the entrances to Sunset Park, Taiga could easily be missed. The only thing remotely interesting in the shopping center it is located in is Sunrise Cafe (which is constantly bustling and how I found Taiga in the first place). I\\'d walked by it a dozen times, and one day after grabbing coffee decided to stop in and grab some take out. We ordered the Taiga shrimp, the garlic pork rice bowl, and the grilled octopus. They also have a basic sushi and sashimi menu, some pretty yummy sounding salads, and some other tasty looking entrees. \\n\\nThe food was definitely solid. The rice was maybe a little bit mushy, and the shrimp which were wrapped in wanton paper weren\\'t anything special, but as far as take out options go I was totally satisfied. I\\'m interested in trying some of their other menu items as well as giving dining in a go, as the restaurant is cute with dimly lit lighting and comfortable looking tables. \\n\\nOverall I would probably give them 3 and a half stars, but I\\'ll bump them up to 4 just for having take out options that I haven\\'t been able to find anywhere else. Extra points because they also deliver, and are kind enough to walk your order over to Sunrise Cafe if you would like them to. If you are craving Japanese give them a try.",

Little did I know there was an all-adult version serving up cold brewskies and typical bar fare for those who woud rather waste calories on beers instead of donuts.  Because of its location, I decided to have a little Happy Hour here for some coworkers and staff.  \\n\\nThe manager, Michael, was more than accommodating and very friendly from the get-go.  I called some days ahead to give them the heads up and they let me know there was a private patio room they would seat us in.  \\n\\nWe had pre-ordered apps so they would be ready to start bringing them out as soon as we got there.  Unfortunately, the patio room had a couple of AC units that seemed to be working on overtime as they sounded like planes flying over head.  In addition, the room was very echoey so we couldn\\'t hear each other talking at all.  I could literally be sitting next to someone and if I wasn\\'t looking directly at their lips moving, I would have no idea what they were saying.\\n\\nThe food came out and it was all typical bar food.  We ordered a few appetizer platters which came with fried zucchini, 2 wings, 2 tenders, mozz sticks and I think that\\'s it.  The wings and tenders were dry and unappetizing. I was very unimpressed with the appetizer platter altogether.  We also ordered chicken quesadillas, nachos and fries, which were all decent. The nachos were my favorite.  Imagine a mountain of chips placed within a large taco salad bowl (genius, in my opinion!) and drizzled with cheese, sour cream, beans, salsa, guac and chicken.  It was perfectly warm with the right amount of each element.  It was a little messy to eat and probably awkward given the professional setting, but still yummy nonetheless.\\n\\nThe service became painfully slow as the next two hours progressed.  Our poor server was this quiet timid older woman who would manage to sneak in and out like a ninja without anyone who wanted to order a drink seeing her.  Someone would say where\\'s the waitress, and someone else would say, she just came in and grabbed some empty plates.  It went on like this all night and I had to constantly run out of the room to find her, bring her in, and yell across to room to make sure everyone got a chance to order a drink.  \\n\\nNo one ever came to buss our tables so we ended up bussing them ourselves and putting all the dirty dishes onto one table.  It was appalling.  \\n\\nIf not for the decent nachos and Michael\\'s friendliness and willingness to accommodate us, I would have given this place only two stars.  But to be honest, even with its 3 stars, I sadly will not be bringing my monthly happy hour party back here again.",

App.\\n\\nThe place was easy to find, about a mile up the road from Bosa on Spring Mountain. I walked in and was seated quickly with a fine view of the large TV playing Fox News (?). Tick...tick..tick. No one came to take my order for what felt like 30 minutes, although I\\'d guess it was more like 10. I finally scooped up an order of rare steak and well done brisket pho along with an iced tea and an order of spring rolls ($12 total). \\n\\nAbout 5 min later, everything came out. Iced tea was standard. Spring roll was good and the pho....the ____ing pho....was phenomenal. The brisket wasn\\'t fatty, the rare beef didn\\'t taste like concrete and the broth was the best pho broth I\\'ve ever had. I was full early on and just kept having one more spoonful...then another...then another...then I was sweating...then I ate more...then there was none left...then I was sad. Compounding the sadness was the fact that no waiter had stopped by for another 10 minutes, so I had to stare into my empty bowl (the alternative of Fox News wasn\\'t any better). I eventually just got up and went to the register. \\n\\nI\\'m 4-starring this for now, but I have a feeling it will be bumped up to a 5 soon enough. Why? Only the finest in pho will get a 5-star rating from me and I have a lot more searching to do! Also, bleh to the service. Blehh.\\n\\nNote: the check-in offer of two egg rolls is not offered anymore :(",

Foie gras is my absolute favorite, as always.  The textures and flavors of this particular dish were so satisfying and comforting.   As far as the lobster pot pie goes...True, cooking the lobster in a pot for 18-20 minutes may make it slightly rubbery, but lobster has that texture far more than any other crustacean anyway...the flavors are amazing.  Definitely a heavy dish, which is why I shared my husband\\'s and I just ordered a couple sides (which were great). You\\'re going to spend a lot of money there anyway...so the additional charge for the lobster pot pie was well worth it.

The house special bacon-wrapped quail was cooked to perfection. But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy.\\nToo bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie. I have to say the service was uneven, like we were an afterthought once dessert was served.",

The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I\\'ve never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I\\'ve ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I\\'ve had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn\\'t care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn\\'t finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it\\'s worth every calorie that\\'s probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it\\'s amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge",

There\\'s a carving station but they only had turkey and some saugages (you guessed it - dry too).  I was told they were out of Tri-tip. I made myself a sandwich, something I never do at buffets.

It was when I was being seated at my table that I realized why the hostess offered me to take a look at the menu before I decide to dine there - I was the only one wearing a t-shirt and mini-skirt and flats. Then I got a little offended, thinking that the hostess probably thought I was a clueless international tourist from the Far East who randomly walked into the restaurant not knowing how fancy and pricey Michael Mina\\'s meals could go for. Anyway, long story short, I almost mistook my Dover Sole for Filet-O-Fish by Mr. McDonalds. The spoonful serving of corn soup that came before the meal was really good, but I can\\'t really recommend this place just for that. It\\'s funny how I enjoyed the Michael Mina in my town (XIV in LA) but not the one in Vegas. Are they sure they\\'re the same Michael Mina??? Just kidding.",

But it hasn\\'t always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn\\'t say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn\\'t feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn\\'t make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn\\'t need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn\\'t get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.",

The hummus / baba ganoush course was really high quality with bonus flourishes like olives and marinated carrots to take it up a notch.  Meat skewers were really tender, very above average.  Chicken cous-cous was a bit \\\"ho-hum\\\" for me but others in my family insisted it was amazing.

I enjoyed the prime rib and bone-in ham. I enjoyed the run raisin sauce, and the various desserts, specially the Bananas Foster. Darn, I forgot to get any of the hand-made crepes. I was just desserted-out. What I think could be improved is the seafood selection. The shrimp scampi was nothing special. But overall, the food, cost, and service is for me the current best value in Vegas.",

As for the service and the manners of the waiter that\\'s another story. After looking through the menu the waiter asked us \\\"let\\'s do this\\\"  \\nWe both asked for water with lemon, that he did bring us. Never once asking if there was anything else we need or even coming back to the table. Once he brought the food out didn\\'t ask if we needed anything else i.e. More napkins,water, etc. but he did a quick walk by and  blurted out water? I responded yes please, I had used the habanero sauce mouth was a little hot. Just then he ran out the front door to heckle some girls walking by the restaurant and even joked with another co worker about getting there phone numbers. Lunch was $22 and change. As we went to pay the cashier are server was standing by her side. We tipped him with cash and wow not even a thank you or hope you enjoyed your lunch or see you again. Absolutely nothing!! Strange thing about Vegas it\\'s built on service,service and more service and word of mouth. I blame management for poor training and lack of supervision. I already told are family how poor the service was. We have watched a half a dozen restaurants in that location come and go this will be no different. \\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time or money as there is a thousand restaurants to choose from and one on every corner in this town.",

We were seated in the farthest corner of the restaurant, there is a small room next to the main dining room, we were in there. It was peaceful, you\\'d never guess you were a couple hundred feet from the craziness in the Conservatory.\\n\\nWe were started with an amuse-bouche of watermelon topped with red onion, feta and balsamic vinegar. It was clean and refreshing.\\n\\nThen, we were offered breads: Italian and sourdough, both were warm and fresh. I preferred the Italian. After noshing on breads, we were brought our appetizers. My husband had bibb lettuce salad with Maytag Blue Cheese, Summer Corn, Bacon, Red Wine Vinaigrette. It was fresh and delicious, the vinaigrette was fantastic. I had the Heirloom Tomatoes Gazpacho with Spiced Crab Salad, Avocado, Summer Herbs. It was like biting into a fresh tomato only I was slurping it off a spoon. Yum. The crab salad was excellent, too.\\n\\nWhen it came to the entree I was torn, I planned to order the halibut which sounded fantastic, but the Lobster Pot Pie that Michael Mina is famous for was included on the Restaurant Week menu for a $30 supplement. Regular price for this dish is $78, this meant I\\'d get it plus a starter and dessert for $80.10. It sounds like a no brainer, but I\\'ve never been a fan of lobster. I tend to find the chewy texture off-putting, but on the other hand there was no better place for me to try it. My husband left it to the fate of eenie meenie miney mo and the winner was the lobster pot pie. I did not regret it. It was superb. I prefer the lobster claw to the rest of it, but overall it was very tasty. The brandied cream sauce was lush and velvety. It\\'s really a beautifully composed dish, I\\'m happy I experienced it. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a filet that was splendidly prepared it was one of the tastiest I\\'ve had in quite sometime, it was served with a short rib cottage pie, like shepards pie, with short rib, carmelized onions and whipped mashed potatoes. It was warm and comforting, not too mention delicious.\\n\\nBy some miracle we still had room for dessert. He had Michael\\'s Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Root Beer Sorbet, and Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies. The float was pretty good, but the cookies, oh! the sweet heavenly cookies were the star. They would\\'ve been perfect served with a glass of cold milk for dipping. I had the Summer Blackberries over Caramelized Brioche and Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream. Eh, it wasn\\'t very special. Neither the brioche or ice cream were a success. Thankfully, I have a dear husband who kindly shared his heavenly cookies.\\n\\nAfter dinner, the manager came by to check on us. We chatted a bit, mainly gushing how much we love Michael Mina\\'s restaurants. He returned and poured us each a glass of a nice dessert wine. I don\\'t recall what it was, but it was not cloyingly sweet like most dessert wines. We both really enjoyed it. Then, finally to end the meal our server delivered a plate of small treats with the check. The coconut macaroons and shortbread cookies were simply wonderful, as was the entire meal. The food, the service, it was all excellent. After three no-so=great meals, Michael Mina saved Restaurant Week.",

In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that\\'s not saying much.\\n \\nYou can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven\\'t seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it\\'s like 90 degrees in the store).  I\\'ll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won\\'t.  Seriously depressing.",

Vegas is a place of flashy exuberance; dripping with neon lights and bronzed blonds dressed in sequenced gowns. Champagne and caviar are as easily accessible as sweet Asian Lucy. Believe me when I say I wasn\\'t in the mood for either. After winning a whole ten bucks on the penny slots, I wanted something good and semi-cheap to celebrate.\\n\\nAfter meandering the pseudo streets of New York, New York, I settled on Jodi Maroni\\'s Sausage Kingdom. Surprisingly, this little stand had a lot to choose from. There are Sausage sandwiches available from Hot Italian to Polish and Bratwurst to Chicken Pomegranate. There\\'s also the good old fashioned hot dog which I settled on. I decided to get the combo which included fries and drink. The hot dog was good and the french fries were delicious. A simple meal, yes, but it definitely hit the spot AND I had some money left over from the ten bucks I won.\\n\\nJodi\\'s is located near the \\\"Chrysler building\\\" and the Zumanity entrance. There are a lot of little tables and chairs around to sit and enjoy your meal and it\\'s also a great area to people watch. Definitely a cute little  place. I give it three solid stars.",

To start i really like the place, small enough to sit comfortably watch some filipino shows and really be in the feel of vegas. But what I don\\'t understand is how filipino food specifically restaurants have not raised to the top with our variety of taste and textures we should be at the top of the foodie charts.  When you serve your clients the basic staple of our country ( rice) please make sure its fresh. To serve me Garlic fried rice with the garlic purple in color this tells me that the rice has been sitting, re heated, re fried several times over that the garlic actually changes colors. This is a fact-\\n\\nRice to me is essential in this situation- Its really easy to cook and it can make or break you as a business. sounds funny, I know but to foodies like me its the details that matter. to some i might sound harsh or out pocket with my reviews. But like any consumer we want the best money can buy, in this case, basic filipino breakfast.\\n\\nperhaps next time I visit the experience will be different. but for now, until then. my ratings stand at 3 stars.",

Maybe it was the two people sharing a tiny \\\"cigarette\\\", out front, in broad daylight.  One of them looked like a cook.  They certainly seemed cheerful!\\n\\nThe inside was kind of dark, dingy and run down.  Come on.  Replace the burnt out bulbs!  I wanted authentic.  Gee, the flies were a nice touch.\\n\\nThere was some loud, obnoxious kid bothering the other customers.  Maybe it\\'s a cultural thing, but my young son wasn\\'t interested in making a new bestie today.\\n\\nThe sambusas were OK, but a bit overdone.  The crispy outside tasted a bit burnt.\\n\\nI had the vegetable platter.  I couldn\\'t tell if the individual sections were supposed to be warm or cold.  I don\\'t think they did either, since I kept getting warm and cold pockets within the same bite.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t a fan of the spongy bread.  It seemed like thin, cold pancakes.\\n\\nAnd I know it was just me, but I wasn\\'t a fan of the overall spices.  I much prefer Indian, anything Asian, Mediterranean, etc.  \\n\\nHalfway through my meal, they fired up some incense, a hookah or something.  The place filled up with smoke.  I couldn\\'t breathe, so I just paid up and left.\\n\\nMaybe if I try a different place, or order something different, I might like Ethiopian food at some point.  But for now, I think I\\'ll pass.",

Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that?\\n\\nThings got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well. \\n\\nOverall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown.",

There also was another group of 4 waiting to be seated. \\n\\nI\\'m not trying to sound like there was a cultural preference... But while still waiting to be seated... Another group of 7 arrived (Chinese) and started talking to someone in Chinese about getting seated I\\'m assuming and they started to walk them to a table BEFORE SEATING US!!!  So I said EXCUSE ME!! And put a stop to that quick. \\n\\nSo finally after getting seated... It was about 20minutes before anyone came to take our order. Again granted it was busy... But that should be no excuse. And remember that 7 person group that was Chinese trying to skip us... They ordered before us... And their food came out before anyone even came to get our order!! \\n\\nI HAD TO GO UP AND GET SOMEONE AGAIN to come to our table, take our food and drink order. They didn\\'t even get our drink order... They had only served us hot tea. I was LIVID. We kept seeing others people food come out before ours and my patience was running thin. \\n\\nI promise you it was almost 45 before we GOT UP AND LEFT!! We were able to get two sodas and they were asking US TO PAY FOR THE SODA! And I had to tell them that is BS and it should be on the house!! We even ordered soup- THAT COULDA BEEN THE FIRST THING TO COME OUT!!! But NOTHING!! For 45mins!! Bad form and unacceptable! \\n\\nMy parents were livid and my mother even started a mild fight with the manager on the absolute HORRIFIC service we received!! \\n\\nThe first time we went we brought them big business!! 33 people!! And the food was actually good and decent. And obviously our food didn\\'t come all out at the same time but one at a time. - that\\'s how it shoulda been on Sunday!

      "text": "Another strip mall jewel has set up shop in Las Vegas. Chef Tony, who has experience as an executive chef in both NY and LV, is hustling and bustling in his new Westside venture. I was turned on to this place by a friend at my gym who said she heard a lot of people raving about a rice bowl place on Durango. The rumors were true - this place delivers on tastiness and freshness! My husband and I shared the pork belly rice bowl and the fish (aka KFC rice bowl).  We both preferred the fish, but I liked being able to share two different meats. We\\'re going to go for the chicken and beef next, since I\\'m sadly allergic to shrimp. The bowls came with perfectly cooked rice - the kind of perfectly cooked, fluffy rice judges expect from chefs on cooking competitions, but very few people actually execute successfully. It\\'s the kind of rice my mom makes in her expensive Tiger rice cooker, but I can\\'t replicate in my admittedly crappy Costco rice cooker. I stress the rice perfection because of the couple of (misguided) reviews who have a problem with the rice --- this is steamed rice, not fried rice. Fried rice is best made from day old rice that is separated in a wok. This space used to belong to Angel\\'s Fried Rice, so a few of their former patrons seem to be taking out their longing for fried rice on this place. \\n\\nWe also split the pho-king egg, which was my favorite item we ordered. I\\'m not a pho person, so for me, this dish reminds me of the best quality Filpino arroz caldo you can imagine with a yummy and yolky egg on top. We also ordered the side salad, which came with 3 generous portions of homemade dressings - wasabi ranch, creamy miso/sesame, and chinese black vinaigrette. My husband loved the wasabi ranch, where I liked the vinaigrette the most. We didn\\'t even bother using a fork, we just grabbed the veggies by the handful and dipped them in the dressing. The vegetables in our salad, and in our rice bowls, were very fresh and paired well with the rest of the food. One of the many reasons I was so excited about this place was it gave me another healthy option to dine out at. Yes, I know, their meat is fried, but you can load up on delicious veggies here and actually enjoy it!\\n\\nTLDR? Come here for a quick lunch or dinner option, where you don\\'t have to sacrifice freshness or flavor to enjoy. \\n\\nOnly con about this place? Chef Tony is a Cavs fan, but we won\\'t hold that against him ;P. I\\'m hoping this place thrives in 2016!\\n\\nEDIT - Updated this from 4 to 5 stars because my husband would sneak off here on his own because the dishes were so tasty! I had his leftovers and everything was still amazing the next day!",

They have $2 tacos and $2 margaritas!! This is probably the best deal on the strip!! You can choose from shredded beef or shredded chicken and they come with cheese, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes and sour cream. The margaritas are pretty big, probably the size of a solo cup, definitely worth the $2. They also have a queso fundido dip that is EXCELLENT!!\\n\\nPROS: The $2 deal is the best! There is a 2nd deal for $14 that is 3 tacos and an order of nachos. The nachos are insane!! The plate is overflowing and is probably enough for 4 people to eat off of! Great deal!\\n\\nCONS: This is not a glamorous place by any means, its a simple little restaurant no bright lights or anything like that. If your looking for a place to be seen and get dressed up this is not your joint. \\n\\nTIPS: If you are in Vegas without a Total Rewards card your crazy! Everywhere you go (that is a Total Rewards owned property) you can earn comps with it and most places give you a discount as well. It\\'s free to sign up so why not. The tequila bar is another place that offers you a discount if you have a total rewards card so be sure you bring it!",

They decorated the place with noodle bowls which added a nice touch. Now moving on to the food... We ordered spicy beef brisket noodle and tonkatsu ramen.  At a noodle house the broth makes or breaks the soup. The broth of the tonkatsu ramen was bland. We had to add soy sauce and other spices to make it decent. It certainly was not a $12 ramen. The spicy beef noodle was alright although the choice of using udon for this type of soup was off. In the span of time that we were having lunch three customers complained about their food. One soup got sent back because it was served lukewarm. A couple ordered fried egg rolls and they sent back the lettuce that they serve it with as it was dirty! And we complained about the lack of flavor of the soup which the chef just shrugged off saying it tastes fine to him! Needless to say, we are never going back.",

      "text": "I am writing this message in regards to the terrible service that my party of two encountered on April 1st at your Windmill and Bermuda location. I understand that the location has now merged with Shoku Ramen-ya and the servers might not have adjusted to the ramen menu or may not be as knowledgable about it. I myself am not a true ramen connoisseur, but I know what I like and what to order. My friend and I both ordered a bowl of ramen; I ordered tantanmen and my friend ordered the spicy miso ramen. Our waitress Annette put in our orders. About 15 minutes later another waitress dropped off our ramen, rushingly saying \\\"who had the tantanmen\\\". I slightly raised my hand and she placed the bowl in front of me. She then assumed my friends bowl was in her hand and rushingly said \\\"this is tonkatsu\\\" and rushed away from our table. My friend asked what she said and I thought I misheard her but I knew tonkatsu did not sound anything like spicy miso. We knew, however, that it was not her bowl because it contained egg, broth that did not look spicy at all, and other ingredients that were not supposed to be in the spicy miso ramen. We then asked a male waiter who told us what they were but he was quickly brushed off by our waitress Annette who said \\\"oh these bowls are correct but you guys just have each other\\'s bowls\\\". She then switched our bowls and left us confused. I then went on yelp to look at the pictures of the ramen dishes we ordered while my friend dived into the dish in front of her. I found a pic of my dish which was now the dish with the egg and unknown ingredients, it looked nothing like the tantanmen dishes that people posted pictures of. We then called the waitress Annette over and she said \\\"these bowls are correct, this is what you ordered\\\" so we asked for a menu and she showed us on the menu what we ordered. Our ingredients did not match the ingredients on the menu! But she insisted they did and we said the spicy miso isn\\'t even spicy. \\\"She then said it\\'s not supposed to be very spicy. Then we asked why does it have extra ingredients in it. So she said well the chefs must\\'ve just added extra products and that it would only cost US a couple more dollars, as she laughed it off. At this point she started blaming us for the switch and tried to give me back the tantanmen that my friend, who was starving, had already eaten quite a bit out of. She kept saying \\\"well you guys were confused but it is correct so you can switch up the bowls again, this is in fact what you ordered\\\". We KNEW what we ordered and this was not it. We asked to speak to a manager. The manager came to our table and said \\\"so I heard that there was a mix up between you two but it is now resolved\\\". We told her it was not resolved and we explained to her what happened. She then suggested that her waitress and staff were correct and that we should just switch the bowls back. She then lifted the bowl that my friend had been eating out of and tried giving it back to me. How unprofessional to assume that I want to eat out of a bowl that\\'s already been eaten out of and pay full price for it. I stopped her before she placed it down in front of me and we asked for different bowls. She then said \\\"let me talk to my cooks and see if there was in fact a mix up\\\". She finally came back to our table and said \\\"oh, there was a mix up actually because another table ordered almost the same ramen as you, and you two got their orders\\\" she then agreed to give us new ramen bowls. Then our waitress came back and said \\\"I am sorry that you were confused and I will take off one of the ramens for you, is there anything else I can get for you?\\\" We said no, we just want our ramen so that\\'s it. They brought us the correct ramen and the check. The check did not comp us like Annette said it would. I then asked what happened to the comped bowl and she said \\\"oh no actually you are going to be paying full price for what YOU ordered\\\". We were then so frustrated that we paid and left. I am very disappointed in the service and especially with Annette and the manager! They blamed us for their mistakes and it is not acceptable",

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\\n\\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \\n\\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\\n\\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\\n\\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \\n\\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.

      "text": "A long overdue review for one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. The lobster pot pie here is one of my favorite dishes out of everything I\\'ve tried in the world, and it rightfully occupies that \\\"My Last Meal on Earth\\\" blurb in my Yelp profile. A 2.25 lb Maine lobster, perfectly cooked inside a pot pie with mushrooms and mixed vegetables in the most decadent sherry sauce I\\'ve ever had? Ugh. This is what I work out at the gym so much for, just so I can have it a few times a year.\\n\\nThere are two other must-haves: the ahi tuna tartare, which is served tableside mixed up with pine nuts and quail eggs, alongside brioche; and the caviar parfait - caviar on top of a mix of salmon and chives and creme fraiche, all over a lightly-fried potato shallot cake (which is the best \\\"hash brown\\\" I\\'ve ever had... and I love my hash browns).\\n\\nThis review is not without negatives; I am definitely not a fan of this place going downmarket over the years. For example, today\\'s chilled seafood platter is but a shadow of what it once was (don\\'t bother with it). Many of the higher-end selections (such as in their steaks) are long gone. Also, why get rid of the famous Michael Mina tasting trios?\\n\\nHowever, the service has not suffered any sign of going downmarket. The servers are as attentive as ever without being at all overbearing or pretentious. The master sommelier here (Joe) is an awesome person to just chat with about wines. I love bouncing all my random wine thoughts off him, and he\\'s really nice to humor me.\\n\\nAnd the bottom line is this: to have a meal consist of the caviar parfait, tuna tartare, lobster pot pie, and root beer float to finish comes very close to what I would consider a perfect meal. And to have every course be from the same restaurant? How could I not give this place 5*?",

      "text": "This is the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas!\\n\\nAces and Ales is located on the East Side of Las Vegas near Sam\\'s Town. If you are not a local, it is not more than a twenty minute ride from the strip and it will give you more of an affordable/local selection on beer.\\n\\nAces and Ales has over 20 taps that constantly change throughout the year. Some of the local taps they may have on include selections from Big Dog\\'s Brewing Company, Tenaya Creek Brewery, Joseph James Brewery, and Chicago Brewing Company. Outside of that, they tend to have fantastic selections of some of the nation\\'s best craft breweries such as: Epic (UT), Stone (CA), Deschuttes (OR), Lagunitas (CA), New Beligum (CO) and much more!\\n\\nThe food selection is amazing for bar food. They have some of the best bar pizza in town and some interesting creations such as the Eddie Spaghetti Pizza or the Metallica Meat Lovers. The Mac and Cheese menu is very good as well with many different selections to choose from. Every Tuesday each week is a special event known as Tuesday Night Tastings. In this event, the chefs at Aces and Ales create an appetizer or dinner item that comes with 6 4oz tastings of beer for $20. Some of the most recent TNT offerings included a Krispy Kreme Burger, Lobster and Crab Bisque, and Baked Oysters.\\n\\nAces and Ales also has some very big beer events! Every first Friday of the month is SNAFU---Southern Nevada Ales and Fermenters Union. This is a homebrew club that meets at Aces and Ales and partakes in sharing their brews and stories with each other. Every Sunday is Black Market Crash where all beers are $4 and there are half-price Growler fills. Aces is also known for its festivals including Stone Domination Tap Takeover Weekend, Strong Beer Fest, and Winter Beer Fest. On many occasions as well they will have brewery take overs (most recently as of 3/19/2013 by Epic Brewing Company and one by New Belgium) \\n\\nThe ladies and men that work here are some of the most friendliest staff you will find in Las Vegas. They will gladly talk beer with you and as well give you recommendations based off your own personal preferences. \\n\\n\\nOver 20 taps always pouring great beers! Outside that, the staff is super friendly! Bar food is killer....go for the Belgian Frites or fried cheese curds. This is by far the best beer bar in town. They have multiple events each year like Winterfest or Strong Beerfest that make for a good all around time",

The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had a buffalo burger and fries.  He said it tasted great and was very filling.  I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I was very pleased with it; tasted fresh and delicious.  For desert we shared the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  Holy.

I ordered their \\\"chicken picata entree\\\" which was awesome, it consisted of lemon flavored chicken (mixed/ cooked with other high quality ingredients) and angel hair pasta. The majority of their menu is outstanding to choose from however it matters most of what you are in the mood for or ask the server to give you the best ideal selections. The customer service is stellar as well as the prices (not too steep). For the service and the food quality this place usually tops/ does better than the other 5 star rating restaurants within the Vegas strip and you wont over spend your money. The location is inside the Caesar\\'s palace mall (forum shops) nearby the aquarium. Again they usually do a great job getting you situated upon arrival however I usually visit them during the middle of the week.",

Chipotle started near the campus of the University of Denver. At one time McDonald\\'s had stock in the company, but a couple years ago the owner of Chipotle bought back that stock.

This is probably due  to the location near UNLV. On my last visit last week, each person working at the restaurant acknowledged me and said \\\"hi\\\".

      "text": "Tea Space is the place to go if you want a huge cup of boba near Chinatown. Their normal size is like the size of a large anywhere else and they have an even bigger size if you prefer for $1 extra. I\\'ve only been here twice and they were very different experiences. My first visit was a weekday afternoon and I ordered the #1, the large House Milk Tea with Boba and Pudding (~$6). This visit was great, our group hung out for hours playing a card game they had lying around called Flip City. My drink was great, lasted a long time because I got a large, though next time I might as for it less sweet. There was a steady stream of customers but the place wasn\\'t packed and the atmosphere was chill.\\n\\nOn my second visit, I came on a Saturday night and witnessed the popularity of this place firsthand. Every table was taken, the line was to the door, and people were loudly playing card games. Alright, so I decided to just get something to take home. This time I ordered another thing on the top 10, a large Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte (~$6.50) and asked for it less sweet. The lady at the register was nice and she asked me to try it and make sure it was okay. The drink was ridiculously sweet and I asked her if they could make it even less sweet. Someone took it to the back but I saw them just add plain water into the drink and mix it up... (water? why not just add more of the coffee?) Sure enough, when I was asked to try it again it tasted like watered down coffee. I gave up. I waited long enough in line and the place was so packed that I didn\\'t want to stay there any longer. Really disappointing as the drinks are fairly expensive compared to other boba shops.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: I\\'ve noticed a lot of uncanny similarities between this place and a chain of boba places in LA called Half and Half. From their paper menu design, to their top ten layout and large boba cups, its all eerily similar and I\\'m curious if they\\'re affiliated. I had one good experience and one bad experience thus far. I like their location but I\\'ll definitely avoid busy days and times here. I still think Brew Tea Bar is the best boba place in town but Tea Space is a decent alternative if you\\'re near Chinatown.",

They are just bites, so order one order for each person. \\n\\nWe moved on to the dungeoness crab ravioli, foie gras risotto (seeing a trend here) and tuna tartare, all of which were well balanced and very flavorful. We requested a wine pairing with our various dishes, but did not want to drink full glasses.

Years later, I read Morgan Spurlock\\'s book, he\\'s known for doing Supersize me. In Don\\'t Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl\\'s as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired? \\n\\nThere is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl\\'s. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path. So I veered left and slammed into that island in front of the Carl\\'s. \\n\\nalso, in the area was the first (ghetto) apartment I had when I moved to Vegas, so I have been going to this location since moving here in 1999. The Ghetto apartment has since been refurbished somewhat as a Siegel Suite.\\n\\nCarl\\'s is one of maybe 3 national chains I go to for one reason: The Big Carl. Right up against McDonald\\'s mystery mad cow beef, the Big Carl is a larger burger for cheaper. Folks, there is NO reason to go to McDonald\\'s since the McD brothers sold to Krok.  They put unsanitary barfed and peed on playgrounds and make happy little sweatshop imported toys so that your kids will nag you to go. \\n\\nSo go to Carl\\'s!",

      "text": "Located in a run down strip mall off the strip, it\\'s nondescript exterior does little to advertise the amazing restaurant located inside.  I discovered this place years ago on one of the many business  trips I make to Vegas every year.  A friend and I were hungry, and looking for a place to eat near by our hotel.  We just looked for restaurants in his cars GPS, and to my surprise there was an Ethiopian place near by!   I often eat at one of the many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in Los Angeles, but had never seen one in Vegas.... Until that faithful day.\\n\\nIf you like hole in the wall type places that offer excellent ethnic food, this place will not disappoint.  I\\'ve eaten here about 8 times now, and have yet to have a bad meal.  All of the Ethiopian staples are here.   The injera (a type of sour spongy flat bread) is perfectly prepared with just the right bite, and a fluffy yet chewy texture.   The tibs and wat (beef or lamb) are both beautifully spiced and  prepared.  The Doro wat (chicken stew with egg) is also excellent.  The little salad that is served with all meals has a nice dressing, and a little tomato for added sweetness.   All of the vegetarian options are available as well, and are just as good.\\n\\nToday I had the pleasure of sampling their Ethiopian coffee!  Perfect.  Strong and sweet, with no milk.   They prepare it in a special kettle by hand on a small range / open fire right in the middle of the restaurant.   (not in the back kitchen)  I hadn\\'t planned on ordering it, and I wasn\\'t even quite sure what it was the lady was preparing at first.  It looked interesting, as it is appeared to be quite an involved process.  I asked what she was preparing, and she was happy to explain to me that she was making coffee, and was kind enough to offer me a cup.   It was so good!   I\\'m a fan of Cuban coffee, but this gives it a run for it\\'s money.  At the end of the meal, I wasn\\'t even charged for it.\\n\\nThe Portions are huge, and the prices are very reasonable.  A meal with soda clocks in at about 10 bucks with tax, and you\\'ll probably have some left overs.  The service has always been friendly, and prompt.   It\\'s a really special place, that definitely caters to the local Ethiopian population.   You\\'ll often see local cab drivers on their breaks eating a quick bite, or Ethiopian ladies gossiping or discussing the days news over coffee.  It\\'s a very authentic experience, which is often hard to find in Las Vegas.   Don\\'t let the neighborhood or exterior scare you away, an excellent experience awaits you inside!",

We usually wouldn\\'t  think about bringing a baby to fine dining, but since this was a vacation, we couldn\\'t put him with the bell boy. =) So needless to say, the whole time they made us feel comfortable and very welcome.

But I also enjoyed the steak tar tare! Fresh, soft and melted in my mouth! It was delish! \\n\\nSo overall I had a great experience and would definitely come back =)\\n\\nOh! and my MUST recommendation is to bring a sweater!!

      "text": "After a canceled flight, I wound up spending my airline meal vouchers here for dinner and a breakfast. The prices for dinner change daily, depending on the night\\'s theme cuisine. My night was BBQ and it cost about $15.\\n\\nLike a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn\\'t GOOD. There\\'s a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that\\'s so-so, but there\\'s some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you\\'re not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.\\n\\nI found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn\\'t care for the taste, but I don\\'t have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.\\n\\nBreakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they\\'re fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don\\'t want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn\\'t disappointed. Don\\'t bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they\\'re all pretty horrible.\\n\\nOverall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don\\'t think you\\'re going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet.",

There were a lot of paper menus in the front & when we got seated & menus weren\\'t given to us, we were confused if we were supposed to take them with us from the front. Our waitress ended up getting us menus after taking care of another table. She didn\\'t ask if we wanted drinks for quite some time. I ended up getting the lunch special & my boyfriend got the AYCE. At first I didn\\'t realize that there were no utensils at our table & I had to wait literally 10 minutes to ask for chopsticks. It took another 7-10 minutes to get the ginger/wasabi AFTER we got our sushi. The sushi was okay. My boyfriend enjoyed a lot of the rolls. It was only us and 2 other families so I really don\\'t understand where our waitress was going. She\\'d disappear a couple of times. Tables next to us were putting their empty plates on top of tables next to them because no plates were being picked up. Ok sushi but probably not coming back.",

      "text": "I\\'ve gone to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in the past, but I\\'ve never experienced what I experienced yesterday. After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in. \\n\\nThe bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, \\\"No.\\\" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said \\\"no you can not\\\" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he \\\"wasn\\'t about to send any food back because it was too soupy.\\\" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn\\'t resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn\\'t like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn\\'t be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said \\\"don\\'t forget to pay for these.\\\" We hadn\\'t had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn\\'t want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn\\'t have pay for the drinks that we never touched. \\n\\nWe left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service.",

The meat kabobs were so tender! I usually don\\'t like meat because sometimes their too chewy, but it just melted in your mouth! I had never tried couscous and I must say I\\'m glad that my first time trying it was here because it was sooooo fluffy and the chicken literally fell off the bone! AND THE DESSERT! OMG!! probably the best thing I\\'ve ever tasted! At this point I was stuffed beyond belief but when the dessert came out I could not help myself! It\\'s a Nutella/chocolate banana filled filo dough pastry baked and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon along with a hot tea! Perfect way to end a delicious meal! I cannot wait to go back!",

Location of this spot isn\\'t the best, but it is close enough to Chinatown area. You may judge this place by the outside thinking it\\'s not all that, but once you walk in its a warm welcoming feeling. The design is very creative. My first order for this place is Hokkaido smoothie boba for me, and Wintermelon smoothie boba for my girlfriend. Wasn\\'t disappointed in the taste Becuase usually the ice overtakes the flavor but this time the flavor overtakes the ice. The honey boba texture was good and chewy. Ordered a small and their size seems like a medium which is good. It took a little while to get our drinks that\\'s Becuase they want to make its taste very well. This place is still brand new just open last week so they are still learning. I\\'m glad this place has stamp cards. The service was very genuine. Will come back again !!",

The flavors could stand a change to something more unique, but they did have a wide variety of toppings.  Price was decent, too.  Overall not a bad place for a quick foryo stop if you really need a fix, but with the many other options for froyo, ice cream and other treats in Vegas, you may want to look elsewhere.  The crepes looked good, but sadly no time to try them.",

Again, ribs were OK and the pulled pork was pretty good, but again nothing special. Last night got just a pork sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese the lady recommended. Got home and opened container to see not a BBQ sandwich but a BBQ hoagie.  Absolutely atrocious. A hoagie changes the texture and flavor of the sandwich and is too much bread.  I paid $9.99 for a plate of bread with a few tablespoons of meat. In full disclosure I was raised in the deep South where exceptional BBQ is found on every street.

First off, the dollar a hand keno is too much for comped drinks, only bar I have been to that does this. The bartenders let you know you need to play a dollar to get comped. Second the bartenders should introduce themselves by name. There is also something about giving a little to get customers to come back, I see this at the very successful bars. I looked around and the bar was empty and hardly anyone was gambling. My friend asked to have the TV changed to a hockey game and the bartenders said no. I understand the bar business is tough, but I think the bartenders are hurting the business as we will never go back, remedys is a perfect example of why the bar is successful, the bartenders are great and friendly.

The pho dac biet (#5 [EDIT: appetizers are #1-#4] on the menu) came out very quickly after I placed the order (not a busy lunch hour).

They have twenty drafts that are constantly changing. Some beers may only last a week, some longer, but they don\\'t have anything permanently, so there is almost always something new.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable, with most 16oz pours in the $5 to $6 range. They always have a few high gravity pours that run $8 to $9 for 8oz, but they are usually worth it. And they will almost always let you taste whatever you want. I usually only get the expensive stuff during happy hour, when all drafts are two dollars off. They even comp the 16oz pours if your gambling ($1 average of course).\\n\\nSpeaking of happy hour, it\\'s 4pm to 6pm everyday but Sunday, when happy hour is all day long. If you have a growler they will fill it for half price on Sundays. This makes most of their beers $10 for a growler fill, and $22.50 for the pricy stuff. Honestly you can\\'t beat that price for 64 ounces of high quality beer.\\n\\nOne more note on happy hour, they have half priced pizza and food specials. There half price pizza is obviously homemade and blows PTs half price pizza out of the water. Most of the delivery pizza places I have tried around here aren\\'t near as good, and you can get a pie for under $10 during happy hour.\\n\\nAnd all there food is good. I\\'ve never had anything here I didn\\'t like. They are known for their mac and cheese and have some great sandwiches.\\n\\nOh and we love the staff. All the bartenders are friendly and do a great job. Dani and Kim are who we usually see (based on the hours when we come in) and they are great, but everyone else we have met had been good to.\\n\\nI honestly have friends and coworkers that have told me how lucky I am to live down the street from this place. They have two locations, though I have never been to the other one, but I can attest that the Nellis location is awesome. If you are a fan of beer and/or bar food, and you are on the east side, this is a must try.",

The wall painting and the music create a nice relaxing island ambience.\\n\\n  I\\'m still not too used to eating with my hands because sometimes I like a spoonful of yumminess.  My favorite was the chicken and lamb dishes.  The chicken was cooked in tomato based spicy sauce.  The lamb was cooked well with onion and jalapeño.  I didn\\'t care much for their veggie platter.  The red and yellow colored been pastes didn\\'t sit well with my taste buds.  The spinach, cabbage and a couple of other veggies were ok but nothing special.  I\\'d order more meat dishes if I go there again.  I also saw some beef dish on sizzling plates going to other tables looked very good.  The service was decent.",

      "text": "Sharon L. and I were undecided where to eat , so we checked yelp for help. Ha, ha it rhymed. I saw that a friend had many check ins here. And since she is an \\\"Elite\\\" what ever she writes must be taken as the gospel. I have been to this location several times over the years for tasty Banh Mi sandwiches. Back in the day I got several picky coworkers to eat the sandwiches without knowing what was inside. Man if they only knew what was in there!\\n \\n  The parking lot was packed and it was hard to find a spot. We thought it might be really busy inside judging from the amount of cars there. Sharon L. kept saying that if it\\'s too busy let\\'s just go to Jollibee. I said with so many good reviews and seeing that the Duchess is an \\\"Elite\\\" this has to be a must eat! \\n\\n  As we walked in I thought maybe we should expect to be given a flasher and told a wait time. But this was not necessary seeing as we were the ONLY patrons there at 8 pm on a Friday night. O.k there was one other woman there but since the waiter was sitting at her table and talking her up. Something  about  are you a cocktail waitress? And you look good you should be! The restaurant seemed a little bit below capacity.\\n\\n  Anyway he came and sat us and gave us some menus. Sharon L. asked if I was having Pho or \\\"Faux\\\"? Since I have come to the conclusion that \\\"Faux\\\" is a waste of money. I told her politely no thanks, I will be having a couple of the tasty sandwiches tonight. See laughed and said your eating a sandwich at a \\\"Faux\\' place? Yeah and here\\'s why, when you eat \\\"Faux\\\" you get the faux feeling that your full. You go back to your office, fire up some spreadsheets and in a couple of hours your hungry again. With only that old bag of flaming hot cheetos from the back of you desk to cure your hunger. No thanks!\\n \\n  Sharon L. seeing that I was right about the \\\"Faux\\\" feeling ordered a sandwich with grilled pork and some spring rolls. I ordered two of the special pork sandwiches, I guess at any other place this would be called the #1. The food came fast and my sandwich tasted very good. I also enjoyed the spring rolls with sriracha sauce. Sharon L. spent most of the dinner dissecting her sandwich and picking out things that she deemed ugly. All in all a good meal with good service. \\nSince my water glass was never empty, I went in the back past all the cleaning supplies and boxes to the surprisingly clean restroom! When I returned I was welcomed by the bill with a total of $17.23. A very good price for what we got.\\n\\n   For all the people reading the reviews about getting \\\"Faux\\\" I quote. \\\"And still to this day, I have NEVER EVER looked down at my meat and saw that green, silver, purple metallic tinge of color that I often see at other pho places.\\\" - Debra W \\\"Elite\\\". \\n\\nWhy even take a chance on  getting \\\"Faux\\\" belly and  some janky meat. Eat a sandwich!",

So we hoofed it all the way to the opposite end and was shocked that it was $39.99 per person.  By that point, we were kind of stuck so we paid it.  But the food was very good with lots of choices.  The carving station had 3 different types of beef which is unusual, along with turkey and kielbasa.  The carver didn\\'t seem to understand English well, those of us getting meat had to point to what we wanted.  There were self-serve beverage stations on each end of the room, along with a small bar.  I had a glass of wine, which was okay and only cost $6.00.  Overall, it was a decent buffet, just overpriced but then, many of them are now.

Mango Green Tea - $3.66 - 3 Stars\\n- Green Tea was bitter and dark, Mango syrup was a bit too sweet. It was just okay.\\n\\n02.  House Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars\\n- Smooth milk tea w/ Honey Boba.  I\\'m not a fan of Honey Bobas at all but the kids loved it.\\n\\n03.  Okinawa Milk Tea - $3.66 - 4 Stars\\n- Smooth and Creamy but we\\'ve had better in Cali. The portion of sweetness and tea was perfect. Do recommend always ordering \\\"Okinawa Mik\\\" if it is offered.\\n\\n04.  Passion Fruit Black Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 3 Stars\\n- Good Passion Fruit flavor, not too bitter or sweet.\\n\\n05.  Oolong Milk Tea w/ Boba  - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars\\n- Oolong tea is a better option if you\\'re not into the dark or bitter teas. Tastes lighter and are smooth with Milk Teas. \\n\\nLOCATION - In a tiny shopping plaza, tiny internal space. Depending on where you are on the street you have to make a U-turn to see it. \\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - Not the FRIENDLIEST or the FASTEST, but I\\'m used to Cali Tea Houses where the volumes of people are much higher.  We waited 20 minutes for our 5 drinks. Prices are decent for the cup size you get. It\\'s the same price for the regular or large so why not just get the larger one right. The definitely can improve on the speed of getting the tea orders. \\n\\nGOOD THINGS - They have a Stamp Card for frequent buyers so you can get free drinks. Pick one up if you are from Vegas.  \\n\\nVERDICT - Good teas for Vegas but we have so many amazing one in Cali that Cali Tea Houses are still my FAVE ones.  But when I\\'m in Vegas next, I\\'ll stop by to get my stamp card punched.",

I had a craving for some oysters so after the waiter recommendation I ordered the seafood platter for 2 and expected nice big plump oysters, shrimp, king crab, and lobster but instead got the total opposite. For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos).\\nThe popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides. The portion of the mash potato was a joke - 2 spoons and it was gone; how can that be enough for even one person let alone sharing.  Same for the asparagus and mushrooms.\\nSpending over $400 plus tip we left feeling unfulfilled and hungry.",

the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\\n\\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie\\'s Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city\\'s best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\\n\\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril\\'s famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.",

We all wanted desserts but didn\\'t want to wait another hour.  \\n\\nMaking the reservations was hard enough to get through.  With one person telling me I had to go through a group with a set menu.  And another telling me we didn\\'t.  Where is the communication?  For being on the Las Vegas strip you would think service would be on point.",

This was our third trip to Vegas and the more I go, the less I want to eat at a casino. The casino buffets are convenient but I always feel I just paid 25.99$ to eat at Old Country Buffet! \\n\\nAte breakfast two mornings in a row. This place is open 24/7 and you can get any item at any time. First morning I had the Chicken Waffles, West Coast style, it\\'s a big home made waffle with home made chicken fingers put on top of it with yummy salted butter scooped into it and you just pour the syrup over ever thing. Sweet and salty, very good! I was with friends and there was an order of steak and eggs with pancakes at our table. Their pancakes are amazing. Big, light, and fluffy  with big scoops of the salted butter... UMMMMM food coma! Oh yes and not to be forgotten coffee was excellent and service was amazing. Waitress was happy to serve us, and was always refilling coffee and water glasses. \\n\\nSecond morning.... I wasn\\'t in the mood for breakfast, we were getting ready to leave Las Vegas via car to Los Angeles and I didn\\'t want anything too sweet. So I had the bacon cheese burger and fries.... excellent! Friends had the chorizo omelet and the other one had the french toast. I had thought their best plate was pancakes... I was wrong, the french toast was even better. Everything was perfect, right amount of being cooked, not soggy, not squished, not hard, cinnamon and powered sugar and then the salted butter on top.... it was the best french toast I\\'ve ever eaten.  \\n\\nWe will be back to Vegas at the end of our road trip and we plan on going back. The waitresses and the manager (or owner?) spent time talking to us and made us feel welcomed.  This is absolutely a don\\'t miss when you are in Vegas.",

After visit two locations now, both appeared to share similar interior design implementation.  It is a casual local casino diner serving burgers, hotdogs, wings, and breakfast items, but looks pretty new and clean.\\n\\nLast time I was at a WildBurger, I tried their WildBurger so I thought I try out their other signature burgers at this location.  That meant ordering The Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich and The Cajun Turkey Burger.  Both were good, but the clear winner was definitely The Cajun Turkey Burger (tasted better and not as heavy).\\n\\nThe Fried Onion String was also a lot better here than the one I tried before, and I killed it all this time around, instead of leaving most of it on the plate.\\n\\nThe Honey Garlic Boneless Wings had great flavor, was not spicy at all (for a medium), but it is made with cut up chicken breast pieces.  Even though it was fried perfectly and is moist inside, I think I will stick to the real chicken wings next time.\\n\\n4 stars for good food at a reasonable price, friendly service in a clean casino diner that does not overly reek of cigarette smoke.  Plus there was no line to wait in to be seated or to place an order on my visit.\\n\\nOh yeah, in another month or so, they will expand their menu at all locations.  So will be interesting to see what else they cook up for the new menu.",

I don\\'t know what was going on when they made these, but the taste of soft batter and hot oil made me feel sick. \\n\\nRib Eye - I don\\'t know why, but my steak was literally charred. I understand when you cook steak it\\'s supposed to have marks on it, but this was unbelievable, all I was tasting was burned leather. \\n\\nFilet Mignon - Good cause it wasn\\'t as charred as the rib eye. \\n\\nLobster - Easily the best.

The one thing that bugs me is that despite coming here several times, everytime we order the kitfo they ask if we would like it cooked a little? No! we want the authentic deal. Also the injera bread is great; slightly sour, spongy and addictive. Really like the Tibbs dish. It is a funny contrast from raw (Kitfo) to well done, but both are great. Lastly I liked the dark Ethiopian beer. Cannot remember the name, but I liked it better than the St. George. All in all very good food.",

I\\'m looking at my original review and laughing.\\n\\nThe last two times I have been here, they have completely skimped on my tacos or really messed up our order. And here\\'s the best part: we\\'re doing online ordering. With explicit instructions. How do you mess that up?? \\n\\nThe customer service also stinks. My husband went to pick up food right before I got off work. We get home and I\\'m handing him his burrito and it\\'s ICE COLD. Like it was sitting in a freezer. There is no way our car was cold, it was a warm day out and he put it in the backseat so the dog wouldn\\'t get to it. When he bit into it, it was freezing. How the heck can that happen? My tacos were also ridiculously tiny - they were filled halfway if that. They also added guacamole which I loathe. I remember when I\\'ve gone there and the tacos are so big that I could barely eat two. Now I can eat all 3 and be hungry an hour later. NOT COOL! \\n\\nSo my husband is so upset that he goes back to Chipotle. A second time. What happens? They try to make an excuse that they made the burrito right in front of him and it couldn\\'t possibly be that cold, and all they do is remake the order. And my second tacos are just as tiny as the first. When you can grasp the top of the taco and have an entire inch on both sides, you have a problem. His burrito was HUGE - my veggie tacos were tiny. We\\'re paying the same price, so why am I getting less? \\n\\nI am so fed up with this place that I honestly can\\'t come here anymore. We used to come here about every two weeks but it\\'s annoying to have to keep going back to do things semi-correctly, and still be disappointed on now multiple occasions. It\\'s a VEGAN TACO. I am the cheapest customer you have! I shouldn\\'t have to glare and ask you to give me more of every single ingredient to get one decent taco. Maybe it\\'s just this location, because I do still like the franchise and the food, but only when it\\'s made correctly and has good customer service to back it up if something does go wrong.",

Really bad service. The waitress could not understand slow and perfectly spoken English to the point she was rude and short with us. Not cool considering we eat Pho regularly and know how to order right from the menu. Maybe it was my blonde hair and blue eyes or my friend\\'s biceps that caught her off guard. Either way I felt discriminated against. Not a good feeling. \\n\\n#2. The Pho broth- Well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to Pros. The broth tasted dirty and just off which are usually a sign of a dirty kitchen.....\\n\\n#3. The meat in the Pho- Where\\'s the beef? There were 3 pieces of beef. Nuff said. \\n\\n#4. Our order came out REALLY wrong. We both ordered Pho Tai and one of us was the lucky recipient of tripe. Big surprise at this point. \\n\\nSummary- As the great C. Barkley would say,\\\" That\\'s turrible\\\" . Since there are so many other Vietnamese restaurants on point in the same vicinity I will not be returning unless I suddenly get a craving for mop water. \\n\\nPHOKING EPIC FAIL",

Any mother knows with little ones, service must be efficient as kids do not tolerate long waiting times. The waitress dropped off the menus and ran off. She came back and wanted our food order. When we told her we were still thinking, she immediately ran off without even giving me a breath to tell her our drink order.  She brought our drinks but forgot one. We gave her our food order and sat. We ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. That came to the table. It was a big platter of tempura but accompanied by the most tasteless dipping sauce. Plus, they only serve it with the tiniest amount considering the dish it was paired with. I also ordered a cucumber salad but never received it so I cannot comment on what it tasted like.  Next we ordered 2 chicken ramen noodles for the entrees. Those arrived and were huge. The broth had no flavor and the chicken was cold. It had clearly just been sliced up and thrown in. It too had no flavor. I thought it would be grilled or marinated or something. Definitely not worth the $9 price, even Top Ramen tastes better. My kids had a veggie noodle dish. I give her credit for getting that out to us quickly, but she did not give them any utensils.\\n\\nBottom line, horrible service with nothing to excuse it e.g being busy or understaffed. And blah food. \\n\\nNext time we will stick with our usual sushi joint down the road.",

For starters, the place is in dire need of a facelift or some sprucing up. The service was so slow that after we had our entrees we didn\\'t see our server for almost an hour! I had to flag down another server to find her. I think they need a dress code, because the clientele was rough for the most part. A lot of flip flop wearing, tank top sporting overly served people without basic dining manners. For these prices, you want a fine dining experience, or you would hit the buffet for dinner instead. I will say, the popovers were delicious, and the filet was cooked perfectly. If the service and ambiance had been even a smidge better, I would have gone back. We will not be back.",

We pulled up to the drive thru (only 1 car parked outside, dining in) and no one in the drive thru. We were asked to \\\"hold on a sec\\\" - after about 3min my husband said \\\"hello?\\\" and we were asked to \\\"hold on a sec\\\" again...after 5 min we were asked if we were ready to order...ummm, yeah. We order and pulled ahead where the girl at the window stuck her hand out for the money, no hello, no nothin\\'. She gave us the change and said sorry for the wait, it will be a bit for your food. So we waited, and waited and watched a table of 4 inside wait and wait and then get their food. Then, we watched them eat. Ok...started to get annoying at this point, yes I could see them cooking the burgers on a grill so they are freshly cooked but come on! At last...22 min after pulling up to the menu board, we receive our food, where she once again says \\\"sorry for the wait\\\". We drive home (3min away). And unveil....well take a look at the photos I posted. Yikes! My husband\\'s burger Camaro Cheeseburger (2 patties) $5.49 he got with ketchup, mayo, tomato, lettuce was alright, just alright but super sloppy! (You have the option to order mustard, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion & grilled onion, all free). My burger, the Mustang cheese burger $3.99 (single patty) with ketchup, mayo, pickle, & tomato was bleck. Totally overcooked and black. I even got free black \\\"crunchies\\\" in wrapped up with my burger - see photo. Totally sloppy! We got a chili dog to share/try instead of fries, cause we thought maybe it will be good and wanted to know in case we come back (which won\\'t be happening) since it was they same price to order plain ole\\' fries. It was slopped all over the paper, hardly any chili, little squirt of liquid cheese, and what there was of it was all over the paper, again see photo! It was alright, not good, alright. I cannot, I repeat, cannot believe it is $3.29 for this!!!! It is small, the same dog as weinerschnitzel for $.99 Cents!!! Total for our order: $13.80. Price it was worth: $7.50.\\n I am sad, I really was hoping for something good here that we would go back to since it is close to us. Oh well. I definitely do not see this places hanging around for long. Sorry to the people who were behind us in the drive thru....hope you aren\\'t still there waiting for your order.",

      "text": "Upon the recommendation of a friend I bookmarked this and it quickly became a MUST do when a certain person I know wrote a review.\\n\\nOn an early day off I decided to make the drive over and give it a shot.  I walked into a nice greeting and was seated at a small table to look at the menu even though I knew what I was going to order.  I  contemplated the lobster ramen but needed to stay with what I know to give it a full and complete review.\\n\\nA short back story, I have traveled to Japan and fell in love with Ramen I craved it upon my return to the US to the point of driving to LA to have it.  Yes, there was a Pre Ramen day here in Vegas not so long ago.  I do not consider myself a professional I am however a lover and a budding connoisseur of ramen.\\n\\nI had to order the ramen I fell in love with in Japan, Tonkotsu Ramen (pork bone broth).  Tonkotsu is a think broth from boiling bones at a high heat for many hours the soup has a consistency of almost a gravy.  Ramen is an art of sorts if you appreciate ramen almost as much as fine art when it is done properly and consistently in its many different forms.  Only certain chefs really do it right only a few succeed at it correctly.\\n\\nThis was done right it had an amazing thick rich and flavorful broth a nice firm but not too firm noodle you can choose all your favorite toppings to add as well (mine are nori (seaweed), corn and egg)  The egg here is different from what I have had here in the US this is more reminiscent of what I had in Japan.  It is kind of like a soft boiled egg but the yolk remains just slightly soft on the edge of turning firm.  OMG LOVE this once you swirl it around in your soup a bit it warms and oh pure yumminess ensues!  For the softer egg fans only if it freaks you out get a firm one but I suggest trying it at least once.  BTW the Charsu here is different as well, still soft and fatty bursting with flavor but I felt like it may have been cooked differently it had almost a grilled flavor not what I have experienced before but I loved it.  I need to do more research...\\n\\nThe service was nice they served a medium size pitcher of ice water and check on you but leave you alone for the most part but ready to jump when you are ready.  When I asked for my bill I sadly expressed my left overs going to waste it was just too good for me to want to leave behind.  She brought out 2 containers and slowly started to scoop out my broth into one container then added my noodles and what not to the other.  Handed it to me and said \\\"there now the noodles won\\'t dissolve and you can eat the rest.\\\"  DUH seriously why didn\\'t I think of that!  BTW my lunch the next day was almost as amazing as the prior day! ;)",

Good evening snack if you don\\'t want to hit up a restaurant but you\\'re craving something after, let\\'s say, Cirque du Soleil. \\n\\nFor $10, you get any number of crepe or Belgian waffle options. An extra buck gives you savory breakfast choices that are definitely more on the health-conscious side. Lots of fruit, toppings, and sauce options. I like the Versaille - strawberries and bananas with chocolate drizzle (truth be told, they kind of over-do it on the drizzle). I asked for no whipped cream and just a little powdered sugar and got.....tons of powdered sugar and lots of whipped cream. Alas. The crepe - while not the finest I\\'ve ever had in my life - was nice and filling. \\n\\nThe lines get crazy here around lunch time so if you want to experience it, better to go mid-morning or afternoon (or late-night!). Food is prepared pretty swiftly.",

      "text": "I have enjoyed Michael Mina\\'s food from his days of Aqua in sf, to Nobhill in MGM.  I was honored once again to dine at one of his fine establishments.\\n\\nDining at Joel Rubuchon just last month, it really upsets me that I paid 5x as much for a meal I didn\\'t enjoy as much.  The signature tasting menu for $115 was incredible.  The six courses will not leave you disappointed nor hungry at the end.\\n\\nDishes included:\\n- Caviar parfait included a base of shallot-potato cake, Alder wood smoked salmon, creme fraiche, topped with, of course caviar.  I\\'m not a real caviar fan but this was exquisite.\\n\\n- Ahi tuna tartare is basically a Hawaiian poke.  Fresh ahi mixed with sesame oil.  Pine nuts and fresh pear was a nice twist to hawaii\\'s poke.\\n\\n- Chilean sea bass.  For those of you familiar with miso black cod or butterfish, this was a nice take on this loved dish.  It was flakey with a great miso flavor hinted with a smokey taste.  It included a wonton in a lightly salted soup base.\\n\\n- Lobster pot pie.  This was the mini version of his famous pot pie.  Nice large chunks of lobster, mini carrots, potatoes and onion.  It was cover in a light flakey crust which the cut off table side.  The sauce was a bisque-like flavor, creamy and delicious.\\n\\n- Wagyu ribeye.  Perfectly season ribeye cooked to medrare perfection.  The HV foie gras put this simple protein, over the edge.\\n\\n- Dessert - you finally end the magnificent meal with a Trio of simple American favorites.  A peanut butter chocolate bar, a chocolate chip cookie and a mini root beer float.\\n\\nI honestly never had a tasting menu in which in truly loved ALL the dishes.  This was the Exception.  The restaurant was smaller then I expected, which made it more intimate.  \\n\\nService was top notch.  We are fast eaters so usually with fine dining tasting menus there can be a long wait between dishes.  Not here, they immediately caught on to the pace we ate our dishes and the next dishes took no more than a few minutes.  A nice touch.\\n\\nThis establishment deserves more than one Michelin star.  I believe I have found my new favorite restaurant in LV.  This was a great way to start off this Vegas trip.  The restaurants I visits in the next four days will have a very tough act to follow.",

First thing I smelled was adobo and lechon. From there I had high expectations, well of course putting into consideration of fellow yelpers.\\nI had ordered the palabok. The first thing I noticed was that it was tasting burnt. Seems like they left the sauce in the saucepan too long. The noodles and meat were fine but the sauce had a burnt taste that overcame the dish.\\nBut after a disappointing start, the main dish came out. I ordered the pork sisig. Meat was carefully marinated and the green onions and sauce was a great medley. Even tho their palabok was not to die for, their pork sisig made up for it very much. Next time if I do come back to this place I would just get a Pork Sisig to go.",

Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \\n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you\\'re into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \\n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I\\'ve had. \\n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn\\'t expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that\\'s was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \\n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \\n\\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.",

Happened on more than one occasion and it kinda makes me irritated that I have to drink something that I don\\'t want. The staff and bartenders are friendly and their sweet potato fries are amazing and a must have with your beer.  The Veggie Burger is actually pretty good as well but a bit pricey in my opinion. They also have pool tables, numerous amounts of TVs, and video poker available.  I\\'ve never won on the video poker but maybe I just have bad luck when I play there haha.

I\\'m never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don\\'t see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I\\'ve ever had.

It\\'s kind of in the cut, so trust your GPS if not familiar w/ the city, but trust me you won\\'t be sorry finding this hidden gem!",

My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and was hoping to have a fun night because we rarely have time for date nights between our busy schedules. I asked the hostess if we can go sit outside and she said yes and she would send a server out to us. We are very patient people but sat there for more than 30 minutes and no one even came to greet us. We almost walked out until my husband flagged down a server. We stuck it out to make the most of it because it was our anniversary but I don\\'t think we will ever go back again because of the service alone.",

Being hungry I just agreed cause the line at in and out was wrapped around the building. When we pulled up to Smash there wasn\\'t a soul in sight. That should have been a sign of something. Dining room was clean and we were greeted promptly and told they would be right with us. There were only 3 tables occupied in the entire building but the staff was flustered and in panic mode trying to run food, answer the phone, and god knows what else. FINALLY we were asked to place out order. Staff was knowledgeable on the menu and offered suggestions and upsells. I ordered a burger for my dog plain but was told about the \\\"Fido\\\" burger (not on the menu) was told it was a plain burger with no seasoning for $2.00. So I got 2. My friend knew that would cause jealousy at the house so we ordered 3 more for the other pups at home. We each got the sin city burger, hers with no egg. After a SUPER long wait we got our greese soaked paper bags.......... (like REALLY soaked). Got back to the house and began eating. My burger was ok...... nothing remarkable (Double Double animal style is FAR BETTER) Fries were ok but I got the Olive oil and rosemary ones....... the cup they came in had at least 1/4 cup of I guess a mixture of fry greese and olive oil which made me have to throw most of them away. My friends burger had a big ol fried egg on it so she was bummed out. When it came time to dish out the \\\"Fido burgers\\\" I saw that it was just 5 beef patties in a salad bowl......... that\\'s not what was described. Anyways I guess the lesson is to read the reviews and go where the line is, cause the food and service is probably worth the wait.",

My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.\\n\\nFood: \\nOrange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a three year old, I would have maybe enjoyed this.\\nChow Mein: It was a joke. There was chow mein all over the floor and counter. \\nCarne Asada Meat: Dry and no flavor.\\nSteamed Dumplings: This is probably the one thing that I could eat at the buffet that had a decent flavor and texture. I think I ate 6 dumplings.\\nFried Chicken: The batter was overly crispy and the chicken meat was super dry. I couldn\\'t finish it. \\nPasta: There is a pasta bar that reuses the cocktail shrimp. There was nothing that special about it.\\nIce Cream: The ice cream is a soft serve vanilla or chocolate which wasn\\'t that special. It pretty much melts straight up when it lands in your ice cream bowl. \\n\\nService: The ladies here were nice but they also seemed to have the same sentiments that I did in wanting to be at the buffet. \\n\\nAnd to top it all off? I got a nice old stomach ache when I left the buffet and chowed down on some pepto bismol pills to help my stomach process all of the crappy food that I just ate. \\n\\nBottom line: I went here for free but I probably wouldn\\'t come back if you paid me.

There was a lot of expectation with Shoku Ramen being the sister store of ever popular (best burger in Las Vegas) Bachi Burger. I was quite impressed after our first visit here and promised myself I would come back. Tonight we had the Bacon Fried Rice for starters, it was unique and tasty. They have two varieties of Spicy Miso, regular and spicy. The regular already had the right amount of heat, any more and it would be bordering on painful and hard to enjoy. We also got the Buta-San which was also good. We enjoy our ramen served with a soft boiled egg extra. The flavors are right on but our only wish is for the pork slices to be cut more thinly. We love the melt-in-your mouth texture of thin and soft chasu like in Fukumimi Ramen or Monta. For dessert, the Black Sesame Ice Cream is always worth getting. Service is good, wait staff is very attentive. Overall, we were very happy with the experience and would be back... unless I\\'m drawn the great burgers next door.",

I also loved the Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass for its rich, tasty broth. And who could leave out their signature Lobster Pot Pie? It was thick and creamy with the perfect buttery flavor.

We asked if we could split into two seperate parties to avoid complications as we weren\\'t prepared for this and we were told no. \\n\\nThe manager came up to us as we waited for our table outside and asked us to pick out everything we wanted to order then (rather than at the table where we could discuss as a group with all of our guests) so it started out awkward from there. \\n\\nWe asked how much this would cost and we were told $25 per person. There was enough food brought out for everyone but only a few different options and we continually had to ask for more rice as only 3 (very) tiny containers of sticky rice were brought out for 15 dining guests and curry (that you put over rice) was the majority of what we had gotten. \\n\\nThe server told us that we were only able to seperate the check 4 ways but I have used that POS system and you can split it as many times as wanted. We didn\\'t want the check to be difficult, we were willing to split even ways but having 15 guests for a birthday was really hard to narrow down to 4 different checks. Many of our guests walked across the street to the casino El Cortez to pull out cash as we were trying to not be \\\"that table.\\\" \\n\\nWhen we received our bill it was over $650. We were charged an 18 percent included gratiuty (I am a 20% tipper but this is actually illegal now in Las Vegas and as a server I would not add my gratuity on such a large party that is already infuriated with me.) when we asked to be charged by individual plates rather than family style as they charged us a $400 family style charge that we were not aware of, they also increased the tip to 20%.

I loved every minute of it.  \\nWe met there right at 11:30 when they opened.  By the time we left an hour later, there was not any room to sit there.  People were waiting for our table.  This is unheard of for the downtown area.  (It was kinda funny that we ran into his mom there eating with a coworker!  Apparently, he has verbalized his love of the awesome noodles to everyone.) \\nI am interested in returning and sampling more of their menu.",

The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \\n\\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\\n\\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn\\'t really care for the seasoning either, but that\\'s a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband\\'s rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \\n\\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \\\"Emerel\\'s Blend\\\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.",

Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\\n\\nThe important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.

Use your current menu as your specialty menu, but please add more of the normal dishes that Americans are used to. Fried Rice, Brown Rice, White Rice. Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Curry- all that can be added as the topping to the rice bowl. You get the idea.\\n\\nAlso, all the meat is fried. A healthy wok option with Asian veggies is a must. I will come back to give it one more shot in a few months once he has time to see what people are looking for in a rice establishment. As it stands, my husband will never eat here again with their current menu. \\n\\nIt\\'s worth a try if your in the area though. Definitely something different, although not for picky eaters.",

This last time in Vegas, I decided to use Yelp to guide me to a place of deliciousness.\\n\\nMy friends and I stayed on Fremont this time. That deserves it\\'s own review, but I\\'m here to heap some more praise on Le Thai. My experience here was great. It\\'s so busy that they have reservations... I called and was told it would be a 1 hour wait. After giving the lady my number, I immediately received a text and was told I could download an app to see my progress. \\n\\nAbout an hour later, I notice that the app still shows there\\'s a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking to the restaurant and were told they were very busy, and the app was correct. The hostess was very apologetic, but offered our party of four to sit against a bar area. We were hungry, so we agreed.\\n\\nThe service was quick! And our server was very nice and attentive. \\n\\nWe started off with an order of some delicious wings and chicken skewers. The wings were delicious and came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken skewers were delicious as well... Moist, tender, and had a great flavor.\\n\\nFor our main dishes we got the Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry, and Drunken Noodles! The three dishes were so yummy! The level of spiciness that we ordered was spot on. The dishes were delicious and the food came out piping hot. \\n\\nMy only complaints are this...\\n\\n1.) GIVE PEOPLE WHITE RICE with their meals. It\\'s fuckin\\' cheap. You want to mix white rice with your food. Yes, it came with the curry, but that\\'s not enough. DON\\'T BE CHEAP. Your food is already expensive as it is, and it\\'s JUST thai food... \\n\\n2.) PUT SOME FAN/AIR in the back patio. It was like 200 degress back there, and the only thing that kept me from dying was the cold water and cold beer I had. \\n\\nOverall a good thai food place. I would definitely return.",

Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Guest got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don\\'t remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg crème brûlée, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that\\'s the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too.

But the lobster pot pie was the ultimate joy. Rich, savory, perfectly balanced truffled brandy cream surrounding an entire lobster, cooked to perfection...and all paired with a delightfully crisp Chardonnay. Oh glorious creation, Perfection is thy name!! Dessert was a pleasant trip down memory lane in the form of a root beer float - unpretentious and delicious.

Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.\\n\\nThe fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.\\n\\nFor a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.com\\n\\nService is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. \\n\\nRandom story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.",

We brought our friends from out of town to bring them here because their noodles are really tasty. The six of us get there to a place that\\'s not extremely busy but busy. The hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So we waited. The hostess then asks if it\\'s ok to seat a couple before us and it would not effect our wait time.  Well it did.... \\n\\nBecause she sat some more before us. So our 20 minute wait turned to 45. When we asked the hostess about this she didn\\'t remember seating those people. We complained to her about the situation and how we were upset and she did not care. My wife went to another restaurant Mercadito and asked if they could seat us right away and about are situation..\\n\\nWhile she was doing that I asked for the manager. When the hostess told the manager that I wanted to talk to her she rolled her eyes as I was a bother. As I explained to her the situation and that we were regulars and how we have been treated thus far she did not once apologize. While talking to her she did even look me in the eyes half the time!  She didn\\'t try to make it better she kept telling me she wasn\\'t aware of the situation. She thanked me for my complaint!!  Maybe if she would come out of her office she would know!! So at that time my wife tells me Mercadito will seat us right away and pay for a round of drinks for our trouble!\\n\\nSo the story concludes with we will never be back and that the service is horrible and the manager and hostess should be fired!

      "text": "I heard rave reviews about Le Thai and decided to give it a try on a random Friday night. I am admittedly picky about Thai food, so I never get my hopes up. Since this is a new \\\"it\\\" place downtown there was an hour wait, even at 8:30 on a Friday. So we settled in outside and took advantage of the fantastic people watching. When we first put our names on the list there was a table for 2 open but they immediately put a \\\"reserved\\\" sign on it. Wouldn\\'t you know that nobody showed up for an hour so we ended up with that table, mildly irritating! \\n\\nOnce we were seated we were immediately brought water. I love me some water so I was really nervous with the tiny glasses they use, but they also bring a carafe so you can refill often. We also got a Thai tea and were pleased with the really large portion. We put in our order for the Thai style wings right away. The wings were fantastic! They were incredibly crispy on the outside and came with a spicy Siracha ranch sauce. I always go for Pad Thai with beef and this was no exception. The Pad Thai was good, but it was very different. It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don\\'t know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting. \\n\\nThe wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read. In my opinion, this is a trendy downtown restaurant so be ready to wait and dine in a noisy hipster environment.",

      "text": "Like other reviewers, I am not necessarily a fan of the chain restaurant. Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife\\'s colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large.\\n\\nMy first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions.\\n\\nAs far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won\\'t be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don\\'t look too closely at their bill.",

Falafel was excellent, served with some hummus.  Chicken schwarma wrap was very delicious and the hot sauce they serve on it reminds me of the sauce I used to get from the Israeli places in NY.  The steak nachos were nice, except the meat was dried out to literally to a crisp.  As I did not yet taste the meat, my husband was the one who commented on it to me.  I then took my bowl up to the girl and she added less dried out steak, because what I first got was the outer layer and then the less dried out meat was then put in the bowl.  That I found to be very accommodating.  Like another reviewer stated, later in the day the meats on the spits tend to get dried out.  Overall, the food was very good and I will definitely return.",

Idk if we were here on a bad day but their employees  seem barely alive to say the least. They have a variety of food, which I gave everything a try and it wasn\\'t horrible but it wasn\\'t good.

      "text": "I would honestly give 0 stars if I could. I went to the mall with my family this morning and I decided to have breakfast from McDonald\\'s. Finally received my food and went to eat a few bites into my Sausage egg mcmuffin I noticed something didn\\'t taste right so I opened my sandwich to find that my egg was moldy. \\nAt this point I\\'m already feeling a little nauseous just from tasting the moldy egg in my mouth.\\nI walked up to the counter and expressed my concern to the lady and asked for a FULL refund she said okay and called the manager, when the manager approached me she said to me \\\"what\\'s the problem\\\" in the most rude way you can speak to someone. I grabbed my sandwich and showed her the moldy egg and replied \\\"that is my problem, why would you serve this to me\\\" because the manager was the person cooking and she goes on to say \\\"I didn\\'t cook it, it was already sitting there.....\\\" WTF? At this point I am completely pissed off and I couldn\\'t believe what she just said. So as I continue talking to her and telling her \\\"so you see it was just sitting there and still you think it\\'s okay to serve me it? Can I please have your name?\\\" Instead if giving me her name she decided to tell me to leave and tell me to never come back. She said \\\"I have the right to refuse you service\\\" at this point I\\'m laughing because she didn\\'t have to refuse me service for me to know that I will NEVER come back to this McDonald\\'s and neither will any of my family members. The thing that got me the most was instead of treating me like I was the problem because my food was moldy she could of just offered me fresh food but instead this is what I got out of it. Typical McDonald\\'s. It is disgusting and there food will most likely cause you to be sick. I have been in contact with the health department due to the fact that a couple hours later I was sick to my stomach. So thank you for that McDonald\\'s and I hope in the future you will train your employees and especially your MANAGERS properly.",

I mean, nothing too bad could happen on a one hour flight, right?\\n\\nAnd nothing too bad happened.\\n\\nI opted for the classic cheesesteak, and since I didn\\'t exactly know what Philly cheese was, I was unfortunately greeted with a sandwich with cheese sauce.

It was a small shop as well, so seating was quite limited. Customers were literally fighting over that.

I wasn\\'t expecting my simple entree order of bbq beef skewers with garlic Java rice to come so nicely plated on a banana leaf. It also included a little side of papaya relish (Atsara). And the prices are insanely low for these dishes taken to another level. The elderly lady I held the door for as she went out looked at me and nodded and said Ma Sarap!! That\\'s  good stamp of approval right there! She was right! My meal was really good!\\n \\nNew Owners!\\n\\nThe former bbq  place Full House BBQ has been transformed! It\\'s now Full House BBQ...House of Manila Cuisine. Yes Filipino food with some bbq items thrown in!  Chef Alex and his team is behind all the cooking. He held the executive chef position over at Golden Nugget, but now this is his place along with the new cowners a family who moved here from the PI couple months ago. It\\'s limited menu for now but what they offer tasted awesome! Location Smiths Shopping Center corner of Maryland/Silverardo. Your visual cue Cici\\'s Pizza..Tokyo Discount. It\\'s right between those two places. \\n \\nAlong with my entree, I also ordered:\\n\\nSiopao: (aka steamed pork buns, Manapua) is one of their featured items and made in house!  Breading just  fluffy enough to hold the filling. It\\'s steaming hot when you cut into it, so becareful! The filling is packed with diced bbq pork asado mixed with a sweet hoisin sauce and they give you a little cup of hoisin sauce on the side for dipping too. This really could be a meal itself or a midday snack it\\'s that filling.\\n \\nLumpiang Sariwa: The Lumpia appetizier I ordered  was more like a crepe with fresh wrapper filled with fresh sliced veggies! Loved this! It was topped with diced peanuts and garlic with some type of sweet sauce on the bottom. Hecka good!\\n  \\nMami:  Another specialty of this restaurant and it\\'s advertised as \\\"create your own soup\\\"  ..Choose a Noodle [thin wonton/rice noodle/wide egg noodle] Choose Your Topping [shrimp&pork wonton/soy chicken/beef stew/meatballs/fishballs] one topping sets you back $4.99! I requested an hard boiled egg to add to mine too. That\\'s my creation ;)  Warning: It comes in a BIG bowl! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were al dente.  The way I like my Mami!\\n \\nTuron: It\\'s glazed w/ jackfruit and brown sugar and filled with sweet banana (Turon) and pieces of jackfruit.\\n \\nEveryone was really friendly, my order(s) came out in a timely manner.For being a new place, it sure was fairly busy! The dining area felt spacious, says it seats 45 ...just go up to counter and they\\'ll seat you if you are dining in.  Or you can order take out too.  Ambiance - felt more hip with the modern interior with clean lines. Even the dishes used are nicer quality.\\n\\nThey are adding more items to the menu. Kare Kare is one of them.\\n \\nSo of course Im giving this place 5 stars right off the bat.  Everything is cooked to order. That alone is a big plus for me.  Also you will surely get more than your monies worth here and leave with a full and happy belly!",

We have been talking about it for at least 2yrs so needless to say I was very excited to try this place while we were in Las Vegas. We ordered the Vegetarian Combo and the Kitfo, as well as the puff pastry appetizer that was filled with lentils. EVERYTHING was amazing! The Injera made for an overall great dining experience.  All of the staff was very friendly and attentive. Don\\'t let it\\'s humble outward appearance fool you. If I had to change anything it would be to have cloth napkins and maybe some updated menus. Overall a great first time experience and we will be returning!!!",

      "text": "My first review on yelp. Only reason I\\'m doing this review is because of Delmonico\\'s Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico\\'s and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \\n\\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\\\"Damn I\\'m getting jipped out of 15 bucks\\\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \\n\\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.",

If you like seafood and noodles and flavor and generous helpings of everything, order bun rieu.\\nEGG ROLLS - some of the best Vietnamese egg rolls I\\'ve had, even if they weren\\'t free. Delectably savory filling wrapped in deep fried crispy layers.  I really appreciate the plate of greens and pickles that came with.

Remember Erik, you didn\\'t eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn\\'t go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\\n\\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.

Maybe they\\'ve toned it down... the salt, anyway.\\\")\\n\\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril\\'s New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\\n\\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don\\'t remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre\\'d butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\\n\\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril\\'s banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \\n\\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.

Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \\n\\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \\n\\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \\n\\nMy friend\\'s side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don\\'t like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c\\'mon.   \\n\\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend\\'s chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\\n\\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don\\'t have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \\n\\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\\n\\nService: As always with Emeril\\'s restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \\n\\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I\\'m glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.",

      "text": "One of my favorite dining experiences. Ever. For so many reasons. \\n\\nWell, the night started out in Vegas with my parents and sister. We came for a weekend of shows, gambling, and tasty food. The plan was to hit up Michael Mina, then to Cirque du Soleil\\'s \\\"O\\\" in the Bellagio. On our way to the restaurant, as we walked by the Bellagio fountains, my boyfriend popped out of nowhere and proposed to me. Apparently this was all planned by my co-conspiring family members. \\n\\nAfter many tears and my dad acting like paparazzi, we headed to the restaurant. I have been vegetarian for many years, so my fiance and family decided Michael Mina would be a great restaurant since they have a vegetarian tasting menu. They were SOOO right!\\n\\nThe waitress was super nice, and after we told her that we had just gotten engaged she brought us the champagne list. Obviously. My parents ordered champagne and we had a toast. After we finished the bottle, our waitress brought us the label on a card in a little Michael Mina envelope. We thought that was such a special, thoughtful touch... definitely going in the wedding scrapbook. \\n\\nOK, now onto the food. We all ordered the tasting menu--everyone else ordered the regular, and I got the vegetarian. To start it was the heirloom beet salad with burrata cheese. A very small plate but a great starter. Next it was the best course--the fennel tortellini. SO amazing, made with fennel and citrus brown butter. Next was the Japanese tasting, with rice, crispy tofu, glazed baby bok choy. Ohhhh boy do I love me some Japanese food. Especially tofu done RIGHT. Overall I loved the menu--perfect portion sizes, wonderful flavors. I was also just generally giddy because of the engagement PLUS the vegetarian tasting menu. On a weekend vacation in Vegas with my family and fiance. Pretty much all my dreams in one. \\n\\nFor dessert, they brought out the tasting desserts. Apple cider, brownie, and chocolate bon bons. But the best part of all was the mini root beer floats with sassafrass ice cream. YUM! and so fun. Tasting menus are always fun because you can try so many things without getting completely stuffed. \\n\\nAll in all, loved the food, the service, and the ambiance. A truly wonderful restaurant for a special night. Plus, it is close to \\\"O\\\" if you are going to that show, which is absolutely mind-blowing. Thanks to Michael Mina for making a special night even better :)",

      "text": "Three of us met for lunch at Brian Malarkey\\'s new restaurant Herringbone in the Aria Hotel on the second floor across from the escalators/stairs from the casino.  Geno Bernardo is the executive chef of this newly opened restaurant.\\n\\nWe were seated at one of their lounge style chairs and table.  The patio was not yet opened because of the cold weather.  Having lunch that lasted about 3 hours, it got a little tiresome for me leaning forward and reaching down to get food from the coffee table.  I can see for a dinner or some drinks and a little food, this would be fine.  \\n\\nChef Bernardo brought out/sent out several seafood dishes to start the lunch.  After an auspicious start with crostini topped with uni, sea salt, and lardo, we were brought three kinds of oysters and then an oyster shooter. I was impressed by the chef\\'s relating how quickly the oysters were gotten to the restaurant.  The Naked Cowboy shooter with crab and caviar was especially good with the salt of the caviar adding to the flavor of the oyster.\\n\\nAfter this, several seafood dishes were brought from hamachi crudo to escolar sashimi to big eye tuna, and tuna belly.  This was some of the freshest seafood I\\'ve had in Las Vegas.  The dishes were very creative too.  A standout here was the Poke with macadamia nuts, crispy onions, togarashi, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, and Shoju with green onion pancakes.  What a great combination of flavors.  There were other dishes each worthy of mention but I will lack space to name them all.\\n\\nWe then moved to the hot dishes with Thai chicken wings, onion soup, bacon and eggs ravioli, branzino, Grandma\\'s meatballs with pork neck ragu, sea bass tails and belly, and a vegetable medley of carrots, French beans, and broccoli rabe.  I am known for not eating wings.  These are so good and done so well, they\\'re a delight and I\\'d go back solely for them.  The onion soup with its pretzel crouton and gruyere cheese ravioli was also a big winner.  I also have to mention the sea bass tails and belly.  Excellent!\\n\\nMoving on to desserts, we were served Adult Root Beer floats made with Not Your Father\\'s Root Beer (5.9% alcohol) with vanilla bean and cinnamon ice cream.  My float was made with Coke and there were gingersnaps served with the floats.  Along with this we had turtle cheesecake, carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and salted caramel panna cotta. A double espresso over ice was an additional enjoyment to the sweets!\\n\\nService was excellent!  My iced tea glass was constantly replaced with a fresh one and water was added to glasses often.  \\n\\nSome of the items we had are not on the menu but may be when it\\'s finalized--we were trying them out.  \\n\\nHerringbone really adds to the restaurants at Aria.",

We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, and the hostess took our cell number and said she\\'d call when our table was ready. (This sounded like a great plan!) So we walked around the Fremont East area for awhile and then returned to the restaurant to have a drink at the bar.\\n\\nWe told the bartender we were still waiting for a table, and he told us the waitress would get us when our table was ready. Not sure what the disconnect was, but we sat at the bar for more than half an hour while people who came in off the street sat down to eat. (Yes, some of them came in after a phone call, but I watched others who just stepped up and immediately got a table.) I figured we were waiting for a table in the small dining area and not a table in the bar area, and that\\'s why we were still waiting. But, no. When our table was ready, it was a table two feet away from us in the bar area. (Why we couldn\\'t have just sat there initially, I don\\'t know.)\\n\\nWe tried to order a bottle of wine while we were waiting, but they were out of our selection. So my husband got a beer and I had a water. When our table was finally ready, we had to cash out at the bar first, which was also kind of annoying. But I still had high hopes, because I had heard the food was great.\\n\\nI love Thai food, and when I go to a new place, I always order shrimp pad thai to gauge it against other restaurants. This one was just so-so, although the portion was large enough that the $15 price tag was somewhat warranted. My husband fared better with his beef short rib fried rice, which I must admit was delicious (and I\\'m not a fan of short ribs). But it took a LONG time to get our food--as well as the beers that we ordered with it--and our waitress never came back to check on us, so we never got to order a second round of drinks like we had intended.\\n\\nAll in all, we spent $50 and an hour and a half for three beers and a mostly forgettable lunch. I hope other diners have a better experience than we did, because the menu showed promise (and the short rib fried rice was nearly worth the wait). But I think next time I\\'ll drive the extra few miles to Lotus of Siam, where I know the food is always excellent, even if I have to wait.",

I TOTALLY GET WHY THEIR PRICES ARE SO HIGH, since their on the strip, but seriously??? TEN DOLLARS for soup???? I had the same soup, (actually better & BIGGER) in Colorado for ONLY $4. I was HOPING to walk out with a Thai tea as well but I only had $20 so it all went to soup & spring rolls. LOL",

Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. At no time were we having to wait for something. The hostess was especially nice.\\n\\nThe Environment - Beautiful restaurant, dark and romantic. A little on the noisy side, but nothing that was an issue.\\n\\nThe Appetizers - I had the Spinach Salad which was spectacular and my wife had the Caesar Salad which she said was very good. They also bring you Cheese Popovers that are extraordinary. The popovers even come with a little card that has the recipe. Nice touch. Prior to the popovers, the waiter brought a little taste from the kitchen, which was a duck liver mousse with a jelly topping. The mousse was amazing.\\n\\nThe Entree - I had the Filet, which was cooked perfectly, but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. It was good, but not great. My wife had the Tuna Tartare as her entree and she loved it. She said it was the best she\\'s ever had.\\n\\nThe Drinks - I had a Johnny Walker and Soda and it was STRONG!!!!\\n\\nWe did not have dessert, too full, but the dessert selection was good.\\n\\nOverall the restaurant was very good. I\\'m a big steak fan, but I like bolder flavors, so I would probably not order a steak next time we come, but my wife will definitely order the tuna again.",

Waters came quickly but we had to wave someone down to take our order after sitting there with the menus closed for 10 minutes. The server had said he\\'d be right back to take orders when he brought out the water.\\n\\nService: Poor, pretty much non existent after taking our initial order. No check ups or anything after waiting over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My water cup was empty and they did not bring water until after the food arrived. I could\\'ve used a refill during the lull. The servers don\\'t have specific sections so we were receiving overlapping service.\\n\\nFood: Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was bad. Instead of the traditional thin layer of crispy starch, it was deep fried in tempura batter. The ramen Miso and Garlic Oil ramen were decently portioned for the price. I like that they include half an egg and spice for no additional charge. The egg however, is not seasoned and just plain boiled. \\n\\nOverall: Truly it deserves two stars but I\\'ll be nice since they are brand new and still going through growing pains. We\\'re still thankful for a Ramen shop near home and will be back!",

I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever encountered such a generously portioned tasting menu and everything from the amuse bouche to dessert was excellent. The two dishes that stuck out were of course the lobster pot pie as well as the foie gras that was close to the size of a sirloin steak. The lobster was very fresh and tangy and the pie crust was phenomenal, flaky to the point where it melts in your mouth. I would suggest patrons to sit at the bar because you can still receive the full menu and share a lobster pot pie as well as the foie gras. Service was fine but I\\'ve experienced better at restaurants similar to Michael Mina. The interior reminded me of a nice steakhouse and didn\\'t incorporate a lot of modern or contemporary elements.",

Instead, the bone-in strip AND filet mignon were room temperature and tasteless. It was the toughest piece of \\\"prime\\\" meat I have ever had. Even worse, while cutting into it, you did not get that juicy pink center.... instead we got a very dry brownish pewter color. Signs that it was a very old cut of meat and maybe should\\'ve been thrown out. We wasted a dining experience here and I felt responsible for taking my party here.

I don\\'t visit Las Vegas very often and was expecting the Buffett to be very expensive but at only $26 per person on Saturday morning I feel that we got an incredible value.  The bottomless mimosas were worth that alone.  The bar staff had no problem when I asked for straight champagne since after 1 or 2 Mimosas they tend to be very sweet. The variety as expected at a Las Vegas buffett was plentiful.  I stayed strictly to breakfast  items but the lunch options did look good.  I went back for seconds on the corned beef hash it was the best part of the meal for me. The made to order omelet was great as well. I loaded my 1st plate to combine my 3 favorite breakfast meals with eggs Benedict, chicken fried steak with gravy and bagels with lox.  These were all good not great but the glutinous nature of the buffet experience makes up for that a little. There is always room for dessert! I tried a few single bites of multiple items but could not resist finishing the miniature pecan pie, decadent! Go early if you can, we waited 5 minutes around 9am by the time we left the line looked like an hour wait.",

The food is not that hot and the taste was meh. The dessert and drinks section is decent. The staff is very attentive to clearing your dishes- which is the only reason why I gave this 2 rating instead of 1. I noticed a lot of other people left very quickly.

We walked by during the day and it looked like a really fun place to sit and eat lunch also! \\nService- Our waitress was very nice, she took us through the menu, made suggestions about what to order and even struck up a conversation with us! She definitely made the dinner a good time. \\nFood- this is where this restaurant unfortunately falls short. I had the baby kale salad which was actually quite good- the vinaigrette was tasty and the salad had a nice mix of flavors. My fiance had the onion soup (not what I would have picked at a seafood place) and it was just okay- not very flavorful and perhaps a little bit too much of a stretch from the classic (they put noodles in it and it didn\\'t have that fatty hunk of melted cheese on top). For dinner we ordered the Sea Bass which was very very bland, the brussels sprouts which were way too sweet, and the death by potatoes which were very delicious. If I were to go back I would have opted for more items from the salt and brine bar or the cold fare. \\nOverall this place was just okay, not sure if it was worth the expensive bill. However I think I would go back and just try different menu items because the service was great and the restaurant itself was so cool!",

Very nicely done and it makes it a little more romantice with my gf.  Place does get crowded, but hey good food means you going to have to wait just a bit.  \\n\\nI came here with a group, everything was already arranged and yes it was very well presented.  We started with two apps (veggie eggrolls and wings).  Loved the wings and their dipping sauce (informed that it was just hotsauce and ranch).  The jerky with sticky rice and thai sauce, heaven.. Tiny bits of beef was very tender.  Because we were in a group the spiciness was set to mild.  Poo, I love hot stuff! Amazing noodles and pad thai were very solid choices.  I thought that it tasted just good, but could have been better if i was spicy.  Should go alone next time.  Another great entree is the chicken curry.  How good was it?  The guy across from me is a graduate from culinary school and he acutally asked for the rest of it to take home.  Enough said.  \\n\\nNow for you drinking folks.  There\\'s quite a selection on thai beer from what I heard.  I don\\'t drink, but most of the guys at the table did.  They got quite a bit that night.  \\n\\nDesserts! Fried bananas, a bit too much wrapping around the banana but then it works well since condensed milk is poured onto it.  Now the really appealing and interesting item was this egg cake with nutella baked.. Sorry don\\'t remember what it was called.  Surprisingly, it wasn\\'t really that bad once you start chewing.  I thought the egg was going to be weird but it was more like a flan with nutella.\\n\\nDef will be back.  Yes I\\'ll have to take my gf, but I want my noodles spicy!\\n\\nSide note: parking is difficult, but there is street parking around the corner on both ends.  Meter parking and free after 6pm.",

We decided to be seated outside where we waited for 15 minutes without being served so we moved inside to the bar. We met Ryan 5 minutes later who seemed overwhelmed with 7 people at the bar. We finally got his attention and received  our drinks and asked him his favorite menu items. His suggestions were the Barratta, tuna poki and yellowfin which were delicious.  The manager Gino and Candice came over and checked in the both of us and asked how service was and we told him about our experience so far. Ryan told us \\\" the best part of the evening is that our drinks were free\\\" ( assuming it had to do with the lackadaisical service from earlier.) Everything tasted great but our final dish, It was the Grilled octopus.  It was softly grilled and a bit on the salty side. Our bill came and the drinks were included minus the grilled octopus.   Need less  to say, in the hospitality industry you take care of your customers",

Not trying to be negative - I\\'ve had several perfectly fine meals here - just giving a realistic assessment.  Sober diners and those who know food should adjust expectations accordingly.

Got drinks quick\\n\\nSelection: Lots more then something like Ryan\\'s or Golden Corral that\\'s for sure. it had asian, american, italian, desserts, etc. \\n\\nTaste: Most of the items I got tasted good. I did not like the penne pasta though the saue was way too high pitched. I like my pastas to have a low pitch and my pizzas to have a high pitch. This place got both in reverse. The Swai fish was my fav item there. Tasted really good. I had a lot of it. I also liked the \\\"tit ravioli\\\" it really looked like tits. LOL. but it was good. I also liked the turkey and I normally hate turkey. \\n\\nService: My sister has Celiac disease. She can not have gluten and the chef there was really professional and he was able to show her exactly what she can eat and since he made it he knows how it was made. Very nice. Buffets are next to impossible for her and this was awesome for her to be able to partake in a buffet. \\n\\nOverall: Highly recommended and very good. pricey though. \\n\\nOverall rating: 8.9/10",

We were seated and our server, Leon greets our table, confirms the Travel Zoo, then says don\\'t concern yourselves with the restrictions just order whatever you\\'d like and the TZ certificate will apply! That was a great way to start our dining experience for sure!\\n  We all started with cocktails, 2 martinis, a Jameson rocks & for me a Manhattan....... Mine was EXCELLENT SERVED ICEY COLD W/ a splash of cherry juice = PERFECTION!!! The Toni\\'s came with Blue Cheese olives always a nice touch.\\n    The filet (10 oz) the smallest available unless you want Kobe.... Just DEEELISSH, cooked medium was tasty not over seasoned you know seared on the outside and beautiful pinkish red on the inside. \\n     A nice change of pace are the Humongous muffins they serve before dinner instead of bread ~ these things are served hot out of the oven & are FAB!! We ordered traditional sides loaded baked potatoes, green beans & asparagus ~ all were prepared al Dente except the potatoes & with a touch of butter.\\n     Couldn\\'t have asked for a better steak meal ~ NOT one misstep, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you check out BLT inside Bally\\'s you will be happy you did!",

But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico\\'s. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn\\'t think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like. \\n\\nI told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I\\'m a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.\\n\\nSo despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.",

The customer service is good. They\\'re friendly. The food comes out pretty fast. The location was a little hard to find in the dark but it\\'s right across from the Tea Station plaza. I would definitely come back here for pho because of the reasonable cheap price and the servings they good are bountiful! the regular size is pretty filling I couldn\\'t finish it one sitting!",

This is a lot of food, these courses are not tiny samples, they are small plates and around course 6 and 7 you start feeling it.

The sofa is not good for shorty (under 6ft).  I have to elevate myself in order to cut into my steak.  Note to self:  No sofa seating.  Another couple was seated next to us.  Immediately, the lady asked to switch seat with her tall husband.\\n\\nService:  Professional and knowledgeable\\n\\nFood:\\n-Appetizer:  Tuna Tartare surprised me with its flavor at a Morden American Steakhouse.  I\\'d order it again.  I also order crab cake but my waitress did not hear my order.  So, we bypassed it.\\n-Comps:  Pâté is a good start with couple slices of crunchy bread. The popover is warm on arrival.  One pop per person  It was a good bake.  Sea salt and butter is it\\'s company.\\n-Entrees:\\nNY Strip 16oz (Medium is Pink, Hot Center) is perfect for my normal medium rare but it is referred as the medium here.\\nBone-In Ribeye 22oz (Medium Rare is Red, Warm Center)\\nRefer to the Steak Temp on the left-hand side of the menu.  It ranges from Blue (very red, cold center) to Well Done (no pink, hot center).\\nSides:\\nOnion Rings is not the kind I liked.  It is not crispy on the outside and the onion is not very sweet.  But, the onion is fresh and crunchy on the inside.  I will pass this side next time.\\nTruffle Mashed (Potato) is heavenly smooth and infused with truffle.\\nDessert:  Sundaes.  I am not a sundaes person but I wanted to try something different.  Again, it surprised me.  The sundaes come in a classic tall glass with a long spoon.  The ice cream quality is high and flavors are well paired with each other.  Each bite comes with a little surprise like a piece of chocolate, or a yummy crunchy piece of candy.  If all sundaes are like this one, I will be in love with sundaes all over again.\\n\\nThis is a quality restaurant inside Bally\\'s.\\n\\nTips:\\n-Since parking is no longer free, I planned my day at and around Bally\\'s.  We visited the Bodies exhibit at Bally\\'s on the lower level.  Then, We walked across the bridge to Bellagio to see the water fountain, seasonal display.  By this time, it is about time for my dinner reservation here.  After dinner, we walked to Paris for a little more site seeing.  Instead of walking back to where we came from, we exit the Paris hotel & casino and walked on the strip and back into Bally\\'s garage.\\n-I asked if I can take the menu home with me because I like the Angus Beef Chart reference on the back of the menu.  The waitress gladly gave me one to keep.",

Of the pieces of pork we did get the quarters of the biggest piece was just fat. The pork belly is also not a traditional braised pork belly there is a lot of sweetness in it.\\n\\nWe also ordered the shoyu ramen which smelled amazing bur actually tasted very bland. As you drink from the bowl you think the soup will be amazing from the smell coming off of it only to be disappointed by its lack of flavor.  \\n\\nLastly we ordered the buns two each of the duck and pork belly. These weren\\'t bad but different probably because I like more traditional tastes. Both had spicy mayo on them which made it really sweet and the pork belly was super greasy.\\n\\nTo sum it up, if your going to come here get a pork belly dish as the flavor from it will make your experience here more pleasant. If you\\'re going to come late in the night they stop seating at like 11:30 though they choose at 12, but you can at least get take out.",

Earl of Sandwich, the (gross) 24-hour cafe at Paris, and Tequila Bar at Bally\\'s...that\\'s all we could come up with around our hotel after a long night of gambling and drinking.  Sad.\\n\\nSince we just wanted to grab something quick before rejoining our friends upstairs, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla appetizer.  I figured it would be small and simple, but it was really simple.  After popping open the lid, I was greeted with four triangles of quesadilla with scoops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side.  Really not that impressive, even though it was about what I had expected.  \\n\\nWhile they put in a decent amount of chicken, the taste was underwhelming - just not enough spice.  Had there been more cheese, it would have helped the flavor...but it would have made it even oilier.  It was already bad enough seeing the grease/oil it left behind in the container, it was even worse seeing it again in the morning (\\\"Oh man...what the hell were we thinking...\\\").  For whatever reason, it reminded me of what you get from the food stands at sporting events.\\n \\nAlthough the food is pretty mediocre, I can\\'t say Tequila Bar was terrible since my friend thought his burger was decent.  They have some cheap deals if you\\'re looking to stay on a budget ($2 tacos it seems), but I would probably just go over to Earl of Sandwich for some late eats.  Otherwise, they might not be bad for some margaritas and cocktails - the ones we saw the bartender make looked pretty enticing.",

Just remember to ask for your dish with no fish sauce or egg.  The spring rolls were quite good as well.  Wash it all down with my favorite new drink, the Lady Boy (Thai whiskey with gingerale and lime).  They also have a rum-based drink that tastes EXACTLY like grape kool-aid.  \\n\\nIt is very small inside, but has a good sized patio.  This will be a wonderful place to eat for the 3 weeks a year that vegas is neither too chilly or blazing hot.  Kidding! I\\'m a trooper, sort of.  And they have heat lamps out there now, so really just do it.  \\n\\nThe menu is small, but everything is tasty, so who cares?

Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here. \\n\\nUpon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn\\'t look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.\\n\\nI ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.\\n\\nThe mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it\\'s better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that\\'s a perfect burger in my book!\\n\\nTheir smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren\\'t burnt or brown-looking). I usually don\\'t like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!\\n\\nI was delighted that this is near campus because it\\'s super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It\\'s a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can\\'t go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!",

I\\'d say the lavender milk tea was a bit weak, a little too much milk and not enough of a lavender flavor. But on the plus side, the drink portions are plenty. If you are familiar with KFT, a small size here at Tea Space would be the same as a medium at Kung Fu, and a regular a large. Although having a large-sized regular is a good deal, the regular sized lavender milk tea wasn\\'t cold enough because the ice would remain at the top of such a tall cup..\\nThey have a stamp card for a free drink after ten.

      "text": "My friends and I were at Container Park pretty late one Sunday evening (it was practically deserted) but wanted some food. Most everything was closed, but we found Cheffini\\'s right near the entrance of the park area. I ordered the Crunchy dog, with onions, red peppers, bacon bits, crushed potato chips, seaweed, sriracha mayo, mustard and fry sauce. Seriously though, I could have ordered anything off the menu and probably would have been very happy. There was a bit of a wait because they had just dropped a new batch of dogs, but I didn\\'t mind. The hot dog came out and it was glorious. Somehow all the crazy toppings complemented each other perfectly and it all tasted amazing. It was a bit too salty for my taste, but my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing and I probably could have shared another. They also have fries, empanadas, sliders and a burger option. You can get a beef dog, turkey dog, or a vegan dog too.\\n\\nIf you like gourmet hot dogs, do not miss this place if you\\'re in the area.",

The location is off-the strip, and in a strip mall of the middle of Chinatown.  Nonetheless, the chef Takashi offered perfection of his creation.  We had nearly ten kinds of nigiri type sushi, fish on rice, plus grilled mackerel, fish cake stew, miso soup and pickled vegi.  Materials are very fresh, and precisely prepared.  Sushi rice was perfectly cooked and flavored. Of special note, the chef brighten up the flavor of salmon roe by marinating as the northern Japanese way.  The pickled vegi is also the northern Japanese version with rice based flavor.  Mackerel was nicely chosen and cooked perfectly.  The chef made great effort for the miso soup and fish cake stew, which can be recommended for every one who loves real Japanese food.  Another surprise came in the end, with the extremely generous size of bill.  I am sure that this restaurant will be the best sushi place in my town if he opens one. Or, I need to find a job in LV.",

      "text": "This was my first Smashburger ever, apparently they\\'re in the \\\"higher prices but higher quality\\\" burger chain space also occupied by Five Guys, Fatburger, etc. \\n\\nJust for an idea, burger/fries/drink here is probably going to run you $10-12. I think the lowest meal price you can get away with would be around $8-9 for the smallest size of Smashburger, regular fries and a soda. \\n\\nYou start by picking your burger size. I had one of their \\\"$12 for $7 coupons\\\" so I sprung for the largest bacon cheeseburger combo\\'d up w/ Smashfries and drink, which was just over $12 before coupon. For the most Bigly of the burger sizes, I was expecting a meaty patty akin to a small double cheeseburger. What I got was more like what I expected the \\\"regular\\\" size to be ... in fact the patty didn\\'t even fill the regular-size bun.  The beef was also questionable, like when you buy high-fat cheap Walmart burger meat, mush it into a patty at home to fry in a pan and don\\'t drain it off, and it comes out all fat-drippy. Regarding beef quality, their website says they use \\\"100% Angus\\\" but that\\'s basically a meaningless marketing term (http://www.chowhound.com/post/angus-beef-marketing-term-642330). I expect $12 a meal for a good grass-fed burger, not so much Walmart ground beef. \\n\\nI know this is an individualized thing, but they do shoestring fries here, which are by far my least favorite of the french fry styles. The \\\"Smashfries\\\" upgrade is only 20 cents extra but I don\\'t feel like it really improves the experience -- they\\'re just tossed in olive oil and rosemary, which makes them taste more like a flavored potato chip. \\n\\nTo conclude on a positive, the restroom is one-at-a-time and well kept. Also better seating environment than most fast food with a lot of high-backed booths.\\n\\ntl;dr for an asking price of $12 I feel like the burger size and quality of the beef and the fries is just not quite there. It\\'s a little better than the bottom-dollar fast food chains, but not enough to justify double or more the price. Opening up right next to In-N-Out is ... well, \\\"bold\\\" if you want to be nice, \\\"suicidal\\\" if you want to be brutally honest. I\\'m no big fan of In-N-Out but it\\'s definitely a vastly superior value proposition with the quality not standing up here.",

I have had many \\\"custom\\\" and \\\"unique\\\" hotdogs and while I appreciate what they are trying to do here, it just fell short. Seemingly made to order dogs are topped with assembly line ingredients that you can tell are not fresh. I had the panchero dog and the sautéed onions were at least a day old. For the price I would expect all ingredients to be cooked fresh. Another reason I am giving a lower review is the staff, the girl at the counter today carried an attitude and was very unapproachable and unhelpful when it was clear I had not been before and didn\\'t know the menu. All in all if you are in Container Park I would try something else. This place was overpriced and definitely under delivered!",

      "text": "My boyfriend and I have been here many times and this is our favorite steakhouse in Vegas. We try to eat here everytime we go to Vegas if possible. \\n\\nMost recently, we went to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and of course, this was the place to go. The prices are on par with other steakhouses, however, for the sides, they ARE small portions, so the sides are much more expensive than other places... but we rarely finish everything because they give you quite a few things in between. \\n\\nFor those who like to saw a few bucks. They usually offer a Travel Zoo deal. That is how we initially discovered this place and we\\'ve been coming back since. The Travel Zoo is an amazing deal! You get over $200 worth of food for only $100... but my boyfriend and I always go crazy and we typically end up about $100 over... but it\\'s all worth it! Don\\'t be afraid to buy the Travel Zoo deal. It says 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, etc for the deal. However, in reality, you can order whatever you want. They will just take off the value of the voucher at the end of the meal. \\n\\nWe usually go for the bone in ribeye because it\\'s sooo delicious! It\\'s a huge cut and I personally never finish it! It\\'s actually big enough to share, but my boyfriend loves the food here so much that he said that although we should share... he doesn\\'t want to because he wants leftovers to eat again! \\n\\nIt\\'s $60 for a giant cut of bone in ribeye and it\\'s cooked perfectly to your liking. It also comes with bone marrow. Other cuts vary in price, but the most expensive is waygu for $90+. This time, we each ordered a ribeye, plus we ordered a 2lb lobster to share. We ordered the lobster tail before to add to the steak, but a 2 lbs whole main lobster is a better deal! It was delicious, tasty, and big! They crack the meat from the claw so everything is super easy to eat. It came with a cognac sauce. For our sides, we ordered the creamed spinach and mac n cheese. Usually we order creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes, but we wanted to try a little something different. All the sides are good though. However, out of those, I would say the truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite. We did also try a side of their special menu, the pork belly with grits. I would have to say that I was disappointed with this... the grits were good, and I\\'m not a fan of grits. They were shaped and fried into triangular blocks and deep fried. That took it to another level and with the tomato sauce and pieces on top, it was delicious! I ordered this dish for the pork belly. That\\'s what sold me... however, there was only 3 tiny and I mean tiny pieces of pork belly on it!! This dish just was not worth it unfortunately. For dessert, we went with the banana cream pie to share. It was a big slice! It was not overly sweet and I really loved the pecan nut crust. I loved the crunch it added to the dish! The pie was very refreshing and seemed to clean out our palate well after our meal. Every time we have been here, they give you duck liver pate to start. I always look forward to that because it\\'s so light and delicious!! You get a handful of crispy bread to spread it on. It\\'s a great way to start the meal. Next comes the popovers, which is one of their specialties. You MUST try it, break it open, spread on some butter, and sprinkle a little bit of the salt they give you! It\\'s heavenly!! I have to stop myself from eating them all before the meal comes out because they are that good!! To end your meal, they also give you some small dessert bites. We were given little brownie bits. They were soft and chewy. A perfect addition to out banana cream pie!! Since we were celebrating our anniversary this time, they also gave us 2 glasses of champagne on the house to celebrate!\\n\\nWe love this steakhouse not only for the food, but also for the excellent service!! It has also been consistently good and the waiter really talks and jokes around with you. We have always had 5 star service here from start to finish each time. To find this place, walk towards the back of Bally\\'s. It\\'s past the Buca De Bupo and SEA. You do not hear any of the distractions of the slot machines and the ambiance is relaxing. \\n\\nWe\\'ll be back here again and again!! It\\'s must on every Vegas trip now!!",

You also have some lemon, seaweed salad, tabasco, mignonette, and cocktail sauce.  This was pretty straight forward and tasted good, except the clams tasted a little too much like the ocean.\\n\\nFollowing the seafood platter, I ordered the trio of Sashimi: Roots, Shoots and Fruits\\n\\n    *  Fluke - Radish, Daikon Sprouts, Honeycrisp Apple\\n    * Snapper - Fresh Wasabi, Cilantro, Lemon\\n    * Hamachi - Red Beet, Sorrel, Chilled Grape 24\\n\\nI thought the Hamachi was the best of the trio.  Most places go spicy, by pairing a sliced Jalapeno with Hamachi, but Michael Mina went sweet with the roasted beet.  The others weren\\'t memorable.\\n\\nFollowing I order the trio of Surf and Turf - American Beef & Shellfish with a glass of Bordeaux\\n\\n    *  Kobe Ribeye - Grilled Lobster, Sauce Choron\\n    * Petit Filet - Crab \\\"Oscar\\\" Crust, Natural Jus\\n    * Langoustine - Bone Marrow, Langoustine \\\"Bordelaise\\\" 85\\n\\nThe Ribeye was well cooked and the lobster was fresh.  The Petit Filet was overcooked to a medium well(when I ordered medium rare).  The buttered lump Dungeness crab on top of the Filet was very\\ngood and went well with the steak.  I did ask the waiter to fire up a new one, which was also a little overcooked, but understandable because the Filet portion is so thin.  The waiter was very quick and attentive in giving new steaks, great service.  The Langoustine was cooked well and the bone marrow was deep fried with a little batter.  \\n\\nOverall, it was just ok, nothing really stood out and nothing was really terrible. I would recommend trying one of his preset or tasting menus, as I felt the Trios, priced similarly, weren\\'t worth it.",

Shortly after that we had our mixed drinks (Old Cuban\\'s, which are kind of like a hybrid between a Mojito and a Long Island, very good!).  The popovers were nothing short of amazing (and they give you the recipe!) and the pâté made me want to move in.  I know it sounds bad but I wouldn\\'t let go of the dish it came in until it was clean (no REALLY).  Next, we split a delicious salad, while still being pampared by Leslie and Conrad.  Finally came the steak (the Porterhouse for 2). \\n\\nIt was perfectly cooked (medium is our preference) and already sliced for sharing.  We also got two sides, truffle potatoes and stuffed mushrooms, both are a must!  At the first bite, we were hooked!  After all that food, we still finished all 36 mouthwatering ounces.  For dessert, we were too full so they brought us two amazing little brownies that satisfied our dessert cravings.\\n\\nWe cannot recommend BLT Steak enough!  It is already on our return list for next time we are in Las Vegas.",

We were seated immediately. We were greeted my our waiter promptly. we ordered an appetizer/egg rolls and the short rib friend rice and the vegetable sir fry with chicken. our Appetizer came out shortly after we ordered and when we took a bite into the egg rolls the center was cold almost frozen...was a bi disappointed on the appetizer. we sent it back. it seemed as though it took awhile to get our food. 35 min or so. no complaints tho the place was busy for 9pm on a Thursday night. once the food was received the short rib fried was was excellent and our stir fry just as good...our waiter seemed very busy and did not return to check on us for awhile. no drink refills until we asked for our check. our experience here was so/so. we liked our entrees so we may return to give Le Thai another shot and try other things on the menu.",

      "text": "Superb!\\n\\nI\\'m sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn\\'t come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\\n\\nI\\'m not a big fan of Ermiril\\'s show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he\\'s not the one cooking my meal, then it\\'s not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio\\'s buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you\\'re saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\\n\\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn\\'t stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet\\'s looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn\\'t a proper meal we would\\'ve gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \\\"Generous Cut\\\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\\n\\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I\\'ve ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\\n\\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They\\'re one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\\n\\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

I enjoy being the Guinea pig for a new restaurant in town!  ...aaaand this is how I ended up at Sushi Takashi for a solo dinner tonight!  \\n\\nI arrived at about 8:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. Kawika was my server and took care of me from start to finish.  He filled my water, took my order, brought out all of my food, and took my dirty dishes.  He was very attentive and although it was slow, seemed to have that sense of urgency I appreciate in a full service restaurant. \\n\\nI ordered the $15.95 combo plate with 2 orders of teriyaki chicken and a half order of the Hakodate signature roll (yellowtail, ponzu, jalapeño). To drink, I just had water. \\n\\nFood came out quick and was plated beautifully. I started with the salad which was definitely overdressed, but still delicious. I\\'ll ask for light dressing next time. The chicken was thin cut (love it when Japanese restaurants do this!) and the sauce was watery, but it didn\\'t seem to take away from the flavor. Maybe it\\'s just a house-made teriyaki sauce?!  Either way, no complaints.  The roll was delicious. I love when sushi rolls have slices of jalapeño on top that are effective enough to taste + have a little bit of the seeds still attached. I hate those itty bitty small jalapeño slices that some sushi places put on top. Where do they even get jalapeños that small?!  Lol. \\n\\nMiso soup came with the meal and was ok.  I literally ate everything off of the plate, including the ginger. Lol. I was satisfied, but was craving something sweet...so I opted for the fried Oreos ($4.95).  How do you mess up fried Oreos?!  I mean, really you can\\'t!  Yum. Yum. Yum. \\n\\nMy check was $22, great value for what I got! \\n\\nI definitely want to come back with my boyfriend and go for the 12 course meal that I\\'ve read about from fellow yelpers!  Will update my review after I wake up from that coma. :)\\n\\nP.s. They have the best tasting \\\"tap water\\\" ever. I saw a sign on the wall that says its Fuji water or something...not sure what that is, but it was really good and definitely worth mentioning. I love when restaurants add little perks like that.

The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\\n          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.\\n         Luckily there\\'s one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\\n        Going back?

The sea bass ceviche was the best I\\'ve ever had! Of the hot apps, I\\'m a fan of the octopus, calamari and meatballs. Geno\\'s meatballs and toast is probably my favorite plate. I could make a meal of it daily! I have a tough time getting to the entrees. I skip straight to the desserts. Don\\'t miss the sundae, carrot cake and cookies & milk. Oh, and the pannacotta... Herringbone won\\'t disappoint.",

(Well maybe not, If you\\'ve been to Tom Urban) I ordered the Redondo beach(Sushi burrito with salmon/tuna and some other veggies). The rice is rolled really thin which isn\\'t a bad thing. But the the size of the thing is small. There\\'s just nothing special about it. It\\'s like they just rolled fish and veggies in seaweed with rice and called it a day. Taste nothing like sushi or fresh poke. To top it off they don\\'t even roll their on burritos, they just use a machine. \\n\\nIf you\\'re from the bay and you\\'ve been to sushirrito, Jaburritos doesn\\'t compare in any way. Don\\'t sell yourself short especially for an average of $13-$15 a piece to only be half the size with no avocados in sight. \\n\\nAs far as the service, it\\'s fast and as it should be.

      "text": "PUSHY AND DECEPTIVE ,THEN TRY TO MAKE YOU PAY EXTRA! Came here with my girlfriend and her 7- year old daughter on a Sunday for the all you can eat for 12.99 per person ( they charged her daughter 10.99 ) We read online that they had two menus, but upon arriving they handed us one menu that was missing many items that was supposed to be on the second menu.That made me a bit apprehensive, and while I was trying to decide if it was still worth it, an older Asian woman encouraged us to sit and asked us what we wanted to drink -I told her Thai tea, but she insisted on a different tea-she said it would be very good-so I went along with what she recommended. While we were looking over the menu (since it was not a buffet already laid out ) the woman again very strongly encouraged us to order two of anything so \\\" we wouldn\\'t take all day\\\" . We ordered -as she insisted- two of each -egg rolls , chicken wings, potstickers, rice , and one bowl of pho. Everything we ordered was very small-usually just two or three pieces EXCEPT for the rice which was piled high on a big plate-enough to fill 5-6 people. After eating all of our food except for only being able to eat about a quarter of the rice plate,I asked for the check (since we were all stuffed) The woman then proceeded to tell me I had to finish eating the rice or I would be charged for another separate order. I thought she was joking, but she then said that I was wasting their food and I had to pay if I didn\\'t eat it! Talk about cheap!! First of all they didn\\'t even have all the items on the menu ( false advertising to get you inside) and then they don\\'t have any food prepared (as in a buffet) then they PUSH you to order too much( I wanted to just try one of each thing at first in case I didn\\'t like it) . Then they try to trick you by making you pay for whatever you can\\'t eat!!? The woman said she told me when I ordered that I would have to pay extra if I didn\\'t eat it all (TOTAL LIE!)\\nNeedless to say-I was angry and told her I wasn\\'t paying extra-my total for three people for LUNCH was already $50 , and it was not good at all -then I am given a total con line that I would expect at the strip from a street criminal! I left no tip and will not return -BEWARE!!",

      "text": "I\\'ve been exploring Thai food as a relatively recentish resident of Las Vegas. We didn\\'t have a ton of Thai places back home in Tucson, so coming here, there is a crazy amount! Le Thai is the best I\\'ve had in Vegas/Henderson so far.\\n\\nWe took a seat on the patio, hoping it wasn\\'t as hot as it was outside there, and they had misters going it was a very comfortable temperature. The patio has beautiful murals and lights. It feel like you aren\\'t in the middle of the somewhat grungy area of Fremont. It\\'s peaceful and eclectic.\\n\\nI am a sucker for Tom Kha soup at ANY restaurant but its always a pleasant surprise to see it done super well. And the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Fried Egg Rolls were super good. Even though the prices are a little higher than the dirt cheap usual prices of Thai restaurant, once you take a bite you realize why. It is so, so good! \\n\\nTom Kha Soup: Me and my husband ALWAYS share this whenever we get Thai food. He hates the mushrooms, I pass on the larger pieces of chicken and it works out perfectly. This soup was the best I\\'ve had. We got a 3/10 on the spice scale. Not looking to die today. And it was the perfect amount of spice. Didn\\'t make your face fall off but also you still got a tiny kick. But if you are a fan of spicy, go ahead and order a high number. I\\'m sure its fantastic.\\n\\nFried Egg Rolls & Plum Sauce: Yum. I\\'m always a sucker for an egg roll. Those and Crab Rangoons are my favorite when it comes to fried apps. These were veggie only. And they were delicious. Not super greasy, as they should be and not flaming hot. As in, we could actually take a full on bite right when they got to the table. Which is how it should be done!\\n\\nShort Rib Fried Rice: This was a new one for me. I\\'m a big fan of fried rice and short rib just sounded good. Oh and it was. There was so much flavor in this one. And the short rib wasn\\'t too fatty, which can ruin short rib for me. Every big piece of short rib was fully flavorful meat and not all stretched out with fat. There was a great amount of short rib in the rice too. It was very balanced. I would definitely share this as an entree and try other stuff on the menu like appetizers. That way you get to try a little of each. \\n\\nI will definitely be returning to this place and tying some other menu items. Maybe some noodles next time. Who knows? I\\'m sure it will be delicious.",

Long ago, I fell in love with the Drunken Noodles at Ayara Thai in Los Angeles, and I did not think I would ever find Thai food I could love as much as that. Well, good thing, since I don\\'t live there anymore, but this is even BETTER!!!!! Goodness gracious it is so good. It\\'s sweet, it\\'s spicy, the noodles are fresh, the beef is flavorful and tender....I get medium level spice and then just go to town on the Sriracha. 10 minutes later my nose is running and my ears are clogged, but it hurts so good!!!!!",

We had a to-go order for a large party about 12 orders, so it was understandable that we still had to wait a minute for the order even though we called it in. \\n\\nI do like the variety of menu options, like coconut fried chicken and waffles! That ended up being a good order, the chicken was coated in shredded coconut and fried giving good texture and a light pop of coconut flavor. \\n\\nThe big breakfast burrito was odd though, it was more like a brunch burrito. The inside was breakfast burrito-ey, but outside it was drenched in red sauce like an enchilada?! It also came with beans and rice with some chips. Quite a meal, but not what you would expect. \\n\\nIf you have time do sit-in and enjoy the meal, but for busy people know that you have the option to just get it to-go.",

Although a good portion of the menu is sushi, they have a broad menu covering other cuisines which is good for my family because not everyone is a fan of sushi like me.\\n\\nFour of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.\\n\\nThe first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I\\'ll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.\\n\\nI enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which of course I had one wrap and the chicken was well seasoned in fresh, crispy lettuce. Portions were large and about 3 boxes of food had to be taken home giving us good value for the $52 price tag for our four person meal.",

This is my second time here and still haven\\'t been disappointed, if anything my visit this time was better than the last. Today we tried the \\\"Chicken and Waffles\\\" and \\\"Chocolate OREO Pancakes\\\"! Both of which were nothing short of delicious. Each has their own unique taste that keeps you wanting \\\"one more bite\\\" as long as you find yourself able to stomach the great portions that they give you, it shouldn\\'t be a problem at all. If you like chocolate and you like pancakes for breakfast the chocolate OREO pancakes are definitely the way to go! The OREO cookies and bits are cooked right into the pancake and topped off with a sauce that is what I beleive to be OREO cream itself! (if I am wrong please don\\'t tell me) and last but not least the chicken and waffles! This dish blended the sweetness of a dessert and hardiness of a breakfast meal. It caught me off guard with flavors that you would think to be very conflicting ones, turning it Into an epic combination of fulfillment and delight! I\\'d love to go on even more but that\\'s all for today, I will definitely be back to try more of the food they have to offer! It is well worth the visit!!!!!!!!!!",

      "text": "My friend and I really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and people kept telling us about how great Delmonico was, so we gave it a try. It was my friend\\'s birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don\\'t actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \\n\\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d\\' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \\n\\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn\\'t have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don\\'t particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend\\'s fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don\\'t know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \\n\\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn\\'t overly impressed by them. \\n\\nMy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you\\'d be crazy not to come here!",

It was 5:00 and people were coming in for dinner and they did not have enough people working to sit people.  There were open tables and people were getting mad.  My husband is a sushi man and he said that is was very very dry.  He even tried it when they had bought more out and still said it was dry.  The watermelon was not sweet it was tasteless.  I don\\'t think they had a good variety of food or deserts. However, I did like the small portions of the way they did the deserts.  They were small portions so not wasteful if you did not eat it all. They just did not have a variety to pick from.  They did not have any kind of pies or cakes.\\n\\nI did however, think the way they cut the crab open was great. It looks like they slice it open.  You would think that the MGM and the Rio would be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas but this time that we were here we were disappointed in both of them.  Our favorite was the flamingo.  They have the BEST buffet in Las Vegas and we give them a 5 star for their bufett. \\n\\nWould we go there again . Mosty likely NOT to pricey and not the best.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s\\nNorthern California",

Everything from the company, to the food, to the ambiance, to the entertainment was amazing. \\n\\nFirst of all it\\'s off the strip, so you don\\'t have that crazy rush of people coming in and out of the place. It\\'s sort of refreshing, after being surrounded by people 24/7. The place is pretty small, you can probably fit about 50 people in the whole place. So make sure you make a reservation, if you want to get seated right away.\\n\\nOnce you walk in you will notice the great decor. Beautiful bold colors all over the the restaurant, its literally covered top to bottom. The tables/seats are covered in plush cushions, which make you never want to get up from the table.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, everything is on a set menu. It\\'s six courses, the first being shrimp scampi, the second being a tomato based soup, the third being hummus and vegetable platter, the fourth being beef kabobs, the fifth being chicken and couscous, and the sixth and last being a fruit, powdered sugar, filo dough dessert. Everything was family style and amazing. Oh and they really don\\'t give you any silverware, so you have to eat with your hands, good thing they wash your hands with rose water before hand. I really can\\'t tell you which of the six dishes was my favorite, everything had a unique delicious taste. \\n\\nThe other great thing about this restaurant was the entertainment. Every 15 minutes or so a belly dancer would come and dance about two or three songs. The girls are beautiful and it\\'s amazing how they move their bodies. They also interact with the crowd, they encourage people to come up and dance with them. When I was there some of the crowd was getting too happy - they were making it rain on the belly dancers - throwing lots and lots of dollar bills at them. \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back again. I will have to take some belly dancing classes before hand, that way I can dance with the best of them!",

Was disappointed at first when we were seated upstairs in a small table right next to the kitchen doors where there was foot traffic galore.  We spotted an open booth and they happily moved us.  Thank gosh because it was probably the most awkward place to sit especially on a first date!  Whatever you are looking for, Cheesecake Factory has it.  I become impressed with menus that have options for a lower calorie meal, although 600 calories doesnt seem that low to me!  I ordered the healthy delight salmon with veggies.  I could have finished the entire thing but didn\\'t want to look like a piglet! It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn\\'t your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!  \\nThe wait on a Friday night wasn\\'t long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!",

The restaurant is located off strip so prepared to take a cab. \\n\\nYes, the dining room is one large room and fairly small compared to other Vegas restaurants, but I liked the ambiance, finding that it lent to the intimacy of the experience. Guests are seated on couches at low tables. Be prepared to eat with your hands (they do provide rose water for cleansing before dining.) \\n\\nI enjoyed almost all of the food during the six courses served: warm bread, shrimp, soup, steak kabobs, chicken and rice, and a banana & chocolate souffle-type pastry. While the food wasn\\'t mind-blowing, I did enjoy it. \\n\\nBelly dancing is dispersed throughout the evening. The women will encourage others to get up and dance with them.

I\\'m a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn\\'t taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that\\'s what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn\\'t finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \\n\\nNEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\\n\\nCAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It\\'s big enough to share with your entire party.\\n\\nBONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn\\'t wanna make a mess, that\\'s why I opted for boneless. I\\'ve got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn\\'t take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\\n\\nNOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\\n\\nFor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\\n\\nCan\\'t go wrong with Delmonicos.

It was definitely my first pinky up dining experience. We were going to cancel the bread but so glad we didn\\'t, the pop overs were wonderful! They come with a little recipe card which I will definetly try. I ordered the beet salad and my love had the spinach salad.  Then we ordered the porterhouse for 2.  It was cooked to perfection and it melted in our mouths. The banana cream pie with the pecan crust finished off our dinner with a bang! We will definitely visit again!",

Well it depends with what chain you will compare it with.\\nI would rank it just a bit over In and out Burger, but only cause you have more options here. The Burger are as well never frozen and deliciously prepared. The actual smashing is more a marketing trick to get a new burger chain on the market and visible. But that doesn\\'t really matter. You can taste that the burger are fresh and nicely grilled.\\n\\nI would have loved to have a chance to see when they are grilled and prepared as with its possible to most IN-out Burger locations. But it is not possible at least not at this location. I have to check others.\\n\\nBut that said i can finish it off with the verdict: it is simply a good burger for a fast food chain.\\nThis location near the UCLA ist clean and the service friendly.",

There wasn\\'t a place you could sit and NOT see the Packers beat the Bears. Plus, it wasn\\'t crowded. \\n\\nWe grabbed a quick bite from their $7 special menu, which is available everyday from 11:30am-5pm. From the $7 selection, we ordered a spicy California, spicy yellowtail and eel roll. I also snagged a seaweed salad. If you know me, you know I am not obsessed with sushi, and I am incredibly sensitive to the slightest little fishiness. I could not handle the yellowtail as it tasted fishy, which to me means probably not the freshest, as I have had yellowtail elsewhere and found it quite tasty. However, my husband, who isn\\'t as sensitive thought it was just fine. The California roll was made with imitation crab, and the overall balance was a little mushy. The seaweed salad was standard. I wouldn\\'t say this should be your one sushi meal or even a destination sushi meal, but if you happen to be at Mandalay and need a quick bite at a reasonable price, it will do ya.\\n\\nPersonally, I would go back to sip on a pot of green tea and watch some football.",

This place is teaming with healthy, fit people (and the cute chubbies as well) because the veg is fresh and aplenty and the price is so good. We totally pigged out for $40 including tax and baklava but usually your price per person is abou $10. Our reco\\'s: Falafel salad with their spicy red sauce. It needs the heat because it healthily does not have a lot of salt. Add some babaganoush, taziki, and hummus (usually you pay $1 extra per side unless it is automatically included) and you\\'ve got yourself quite the  Mediterranean spread. The Hummus plate is great as wel. Just the Hummus with pita chips is worth getting. Their fresh pita chips are soo good. \\n\\nDon\\'t forget the Cucumber Chiller for $1.99. The yellow curry is fabulous as well, rice is seasoned so well you could eat it by itself. Next time I\\'m going to get the Nachos. Yum.",
