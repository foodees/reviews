It was a very nice experience we were greeted and seated. The waiter was extremely nice and helped us pick out what we wanted . We actually ended up doing the tasting menu.

Rounded up to three stars because of the business hours.  All the usual suspects on the menu so no surprises there.  The BBQ and noodle dishes are not be as good as other places, but they get a pass because they stay open way late.  So really the main reason to come here is because most of the better HK places have already closed; and if it\\'s that late at night, chances are you\\'ll be pretty drunk so the food will be perfectly acceptable.	0	0	0

I usually get the beef stew and wonton. Also, don\\'t forget to get a side of siopao. There\\'s 3 choices of noodles, and I love love love the thin egg noodle. Reminds me of back home (Daly city , ca) when I used to eat at this noodle soup house called \\"ling nam\\" \\n\\nTheir Java rice is really tasty as well! I definitely will be coming back here and bringing my family	1	0	1

While in vegas I got a bellagio chicken because it made me think of the belliagio hotel. So good! I also like their pastas, pasta da venchi and evelyns. My dad loves their meat loaf. Everything is really good and portions are so generous! Moderately priced. Located in cesars palace. Annoyed that the water is served in a plastic cup, get some glass ones! Free bread, the brown one is amazing!	0	0	0

They brought out a few small appetizers and a complimentary glass of Champaign and a small bouquet of yellow and orange Daisy\\'s for  my birthday. I ordered the seafood platter it was great. then I ordered the 6  oz filet mignon cooked to perfection med rare and great flavor melt in my mouth. My husband has the rack of Lamb that was the best he has ever had for dinning out. Oh and yes the muffins they bring before the meal are absolutely the best. . I will go back for sure!!!!  Even the chef came out to wish me a Happy Birthday ... it was by far the best Birthday dinner ever.. oh did I mention the person crusted banana cream pie with Carmel drizzled over the top .... need I say anymore. Thank you Omar and the female chef for making my Birthday so enjoyable.	0	0	0

Don\\'t skip the pickles.\\n\\nMy disappointment was they no longer had the lobster ramen I had read about.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint is the room is always too cold.

I have been going to Delmonico since about four year ago and I have never been disappointed once.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don\\'t even come close to this one.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.\\n\\nGive this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.	3	0	1

This place pretty much is a copy cat of that place. Well I just happy that I have found a new hang out place in this dessert city. \\nThe place is so neat and btw they are cats maniac!! \\nTheir tea is pretty light in sweet if you ask for less sugar so it\\'s perfect for me. \\nI just can\\'t wait to coming back!!	0	0	0

We decided to order the chicken El Jefe Nachos and 3 Carne Asada tacos.... WOW! My fiancé and I  decided to share this meal! The nachos are HUGE!!! They are by far the best nachos ever! Plus they were super cheap! The following day... Since we liked what we had we decided to go for breakfast. I got the chilaquiles and another WOW! This was the most amazing thing I\\'ve ever tried!! I would recommend this to every single person. Now we are here 3rd day, we just heard they are closing down. Apparently Some Italian chain bought them out. We are absolutely heart broken. We thought we found our new favorite spot. The staff has been amazing! Especially Cynthia.... I\\'m saddened to hear they will no longer be here. Service is ahhhh-mazing, just like to food!	0	0	0

We stroll in for something to eat, and find that it\\'s very obviously family-owned. I love places like this, but my experience here was a bit...uncertain. \\n\\nI ordered a customized soup with rice noodles and shrimp and pork dumplings, and the fiancé ordered a grilled chicken dish. Hands down, the best grilled chicken I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of eating. It was surprisingly amazing. Moist, tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The light char on it was fantastic. The side of rice was also delicious. \\n\\nThe soup, however, was a little off. The broth was tasty, and the noodles were cooked perfectly...but I\\'m inclined to believe that the dumplings had me doubled over an hour later (give or take). I bit into a single one and knew something was wrong. The waitress must have seen the perplexed look upon my face, because she came over asking me specifically if everything was alright (she was really sweet). I told her it was fine, because, honestly, we\\'ve all either endured the dark happenings of restaurants first hand, or have watched Waiting. I won\\'t send food back and order anything afterwards. (Definitely not saying that this establishment would purposefully contaminate my food, but, from experience, I just don\\'t feel comfortable doing it.)\\n\\nI drank the broth, ate the noodles, and built up the guts to try one more dumpling. That one tasted perfectly fine. Delicious, in fact. But it may have been a single, fluke dumpling that kept me clutching at my disgruntled tummy for hours after. However, I cannot directly make that claim, nor do I want to. \\n\\nFlan (free with Yelp Check-in) was so awesome. I\\'d consider it a fairly dense flan, maybe a pudding, but it was great, nonetheless. In my top five. \\n\\nOverall, the food was quick to come out. Our waitress was very sweet and insanely adorable. The food itself was delicious, though I continue to question. And the establishment is very clean with cute decor. I\\'ll take a second chance here, if we\\'re ever that far from the center of town.	7	1	5

It\\'s kind of strange to enter the dining room through a bar via a special sensor associated with a hand wave.  The bar was dark with a few slots and seemed like a cool place.  The dining room, once we got through the sensor, was nice enough.  Clean, very quiet, and comfy with two large-screen tvs and nice cloth napkins.  Enough on the aesthetics.  \\n\\nMy wife and I ordered the filet mignons with salads and baked potatoes.  They steaks were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor and were very tender.  The baked potatoes were rolled in a salt/pepper mix and were great.  The salad was a basic variety dish.  We were extremely pleased with the service, food, price, and atmosphere.  It was really a neat experience.  The only suggestion I would make to them would be to have better servings of butter.  They were way too small and many had to be used. \\n\\nBut wait, there\\'s more!   We went back the next morning for breakfast.  We had the French toast and bacon.  Again, the French toast was fantastic and the bacon was to die for.  Couldn\\'t have been more pleased. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in the area (we were in the adjacent RV park) it is well worth your visiting.  Great place at a great value.	0	0	0

I came here with my friends for lunch since we were in vegas for the weekend.\\n\\nThe wait was only 15-20 minutes and since we were there for lunch we weren\\'t sure how the portions were. We only had dinner at cheesecake and never lunch. So we asked about the lunch portions and still it was huge. My friend and I ended up sharing the BBQ chicken cobb salad which I absolutely love and my other friend got their fish and chips.\\n\\nService was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn\\'t drenched in the dressing. It seemed to be perfected dressed and you can taste the different tastes rather than everything having one flavor. That was probably the distinction between the two places which was nice for a change.	1	0	0

Not only you get an amazing choice of cheesecakes (and cakes in general) which are just delicious... but also the food is great! I\\'ve tried the Smokehouse BBQ Burger twice and I have to admit it was one of the best I\\'ve ever had and better than the one I had at Gordon Ramsay\\'s BurGR the day before.\\n\\nDefinitely recommended (it\\'s also non-expensive), but remember to show up early (or late) for dinner as the place is always packed!	0	0	0

We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.\\n\\nI ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.	0	0	0

The service from the moment you walk in is what you expect from a nice restaurant.\\n\\nThere were seven of us for dinner on a Tuesday and the place was jam packed. The service wasn\\'t impacted at all. Everyone who touched the table had a touch of class mixed with a sense of humor.\\n\\nOur part ordered almost every entree on the menu with everyone raving. A few of us split the lobster pot pie. If you order it, definitely split it. Half an order was plenty. It is creamy which they warn/tell you about ahead of time.\\n\\nThe wine list is exhaustive and if you are the one picking the wine will make you anti-social for about 10-15 minutes while you choose.\\n\\nWould definitely go again.	1	0	0

Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\\n\\nWhat we put in our tummies:\\n(pictures posted)\\n\\n1st Course\\nTraditional New Orleans\\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\\n\\n2nd Course\\nButternut Squash Ravioli\\nPrime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\\n\\n3rd Course\\nEmeril\\'s Banana Cream Pie\\nPecan Pie\\n\\nI\\'m no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\\n\\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I\\'m a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it\\'s written \\"Emeril\\'s Banana Cream Pie.\\" I\\'m sure it\\'s not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\\n\\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I\\'ve been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \\n\\nPersonally, I\\'m very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It\\'s so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \\n\\nI\\'m very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!	12	4	6

They have awesome goblet drinks that are full of candy and are super delicious! We ordered their lollipop passion goblet which is described on the menu as \\"a wonderful mix of melon, coconut and pineapple blended together to create a taste sensation no one will be able to resist! Garnished with lollipops\\" Our goblet came to the table and it is huge, I am glad the husband and I decided to share this drink. It had two huge rainbow lollipops and a candy necklace inside. The server pours our drink and we were surprised it had some kind of dry ice or something in it to make the drink bubble and smoke. (It was super neat) We had great service, the woman who took care of us was very attentive even though we only came in to order a drink to share. The drinks are expensive though and I wish I knew beforehand that yelp has a special. If you check in on yelp you get 50% off your goblet drink, which would have saved us at least $25, but you live and you learn! Next time I would for sure use the check in offer if it is still available. \\nOverall the drink was super refreshing and not too sweet. We will return. The decor of the restaurant is super cute, they have awesome looking food and great service.	2	0	2

Well not really but you get the picture. The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level!

Even without serving their full menu they had a great selection of food to choose from and the beer and drink list is even greater. The prices are very cheap compared to food anywhere else. The beef brisket was delicious as well as their ribs! Cannot wait to come back and try out their full menu and see everything that they have to offer. The cherry on top would be the great view of the Las Vegas Strip as well as the Bellagio Fountains!	0	0	0

I\\'m drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).\\n\\nI loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.\\n\\nBefore we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\\n\\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\\n\\nI had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming\\'s. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn\\'t even want to dip it in Emeril\\'s version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it\\'s an Emeril restaurant.. didn\\'t know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\\n\\nWe shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn\\'t use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\\n\\nLastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.	0	0	0

Options were limited so we choose Smashburger. \\n\\nI ordered the Classic Smashburger with smash fries. I have to say unequivocally this is the BEST fast food burger I\\'ve had so far. The meat was juicy, well seasoned with good fixings and great egg bun. The fries are seasoned with rosemary and are REALLY, REALY good!\\n\\nHighly recommended for a good quick bite.	0	0	0

A handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. Tuna tartare was great and the crab legs were great.\\n\\nWarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. There was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn\\'t really that much of a salad. Still it was good.\\n\\nAdded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). That was magnificent. Huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  Had the creamed spinach ($10), creamed corn ($10) and steak fries ($10). The creamed corn want good. It was just bland. The rest were good.\\n\\nService is exceptional. Had a few Tito vodka Martina\\'s with blue cheese olives as well Jacob were expertly made. For 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. Be prepared to spend $$$.	0	0	0

I usually make mine w/shredded pork (bi) and meatballs (shrimp and ground pork). Well, this place didn\\'t make it w/ meatballs, but it came with grilled pork! My eyes were wide open and I indulge right away! It was one of the best banh tam I ever had! I never thought of having grilled pork with it! Awesomness!!! Banh tam is served with mixed vegies, coconut milk, and nuoc mam (fish sauce). And they offered 2 free eggrolls if you check in! :)	1	0	0

Probably good for a group of 3-4\\n\\nBeverages:\\nMatcha iced tea 0/10\\n     Really tasteless. Tasted like water with green food dye. And my boyfriend and I both usually really enjoy green tea.\\nThai tea with boba 7/10\\n     The thai tea itself was delicious but the boba balls were hard and tasted a little old. I would suggest the thai tea but with no boba balls.\\n\\n\\nAmbiance: 7/10\\nNewly renovated from the old bachi burger so the place had a really nice open, modern feel. It was pretty small though, especially for 2 restaurants in one.\\n\\n\\nOverall: 7/10\\nI would come back. But I wouldn\\'t drive across town just for this place.	1	0	0

We got seated and although we told the guy we alrdy knew what we wanted, he took like 10 min to take our order. Another viet fam had came in after us and their order was taken before ours! No, my fam and I are not viet, we are cambodian LOL. Anyways, the four in my fam all order pho and I ordered the pork vermicelli bowl. It took awhile for our food to come out too! \\n\\nI did not tell my family nor the server, but there was f****ing fruit fly in my fish sauce! I didn\\'t say anything because I didn\\'t want my fam to lose their appetite since they were alrdy hesitant coming here. So I just scooped it out and used the extra sauce I asked for. My dish barely had any noodles....mainly veggies. That sucked. But it was still good, I guess. None of the workers came to check up on us or anything. \\n\\nShould have went with our other pho choice.	0	0	0

By far the best Korean food I\\'ve had in Las Vegas!! All of the dishes we ordered were so good and did not disappoint.

I wanted to order two but since it was a line like kinda deal I was hesitant to even ask for another.\\n\\nI ordered a chicken burrito and the way they made it seemed like it was half a burrito..like a square shaped burrito and not the usual rectangular shape which made me think I was jipped. \\n\\nI\\'d eat there again but it\\'s nothing to go crazy over for.	2	0	1

The food is nothing special, the service is terrible, and the staff are pretentious. The calling for a table on Yelp does not much good as after a 40 minute wait per the phone, we had to wait another 30 minutes once we arrived. Even the Thai tea was bland and unworth the expense. New host is a must and I would prefer if the waiters didn\\'t mention that they were going to take the food left in a to go container by a nearby former patron to the back for their own consumption.	4	2	1

We try to eat here everytime we go to Vegas if possible. \\n\\nMost recently, we went to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and of course, this was the place to go. The prices are on par with other steakhouses, however, for the sides, they ARE small portions, so the sides are much more expensive than other places... but we rarely finish everything because they give you quite a few things in between. \\n\\nFor those who like to saw a few bucks. They usually offer a Travel Zoo deal. That is how we initially discovered this place and we\\'ve been coming back since. The Travel Zoo is an amazing deal! You get over $200 worth of food for only $100... but my boyfriend and I always go crazy and we typically end up about $100 over... but it\\'s all worth it! Don\\'t be afraid to buy the Travel Zoo deal. It says 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, etc for the deal. However, in reality, you can order whatever you want. They will just take off the value of the voucher at the end of the meal. \\n\\nWe usually go for the bone in ribeye because it\\'s sooo delicious! It\\'s a huge cut and I personally never finish it! It\\'s actually big enough to share, but my boyfriend loves the food here so much that he said that although we should share... he doesn\\'t want to because he wants leftovers to eat again! \\n\\nIt\\'s $60 for a giant cut of bone in ribeye and it\\'s cooked perfectly to your liking. It also comes with bone marrow. Other cuts vary in price, but the most expensive is waygu for $90+. This time, we each ordered a ribeye, plus we ordered a 2lb lobster to share. We ordered the lobster tail before to add to the steak, but a 2 lbs whole main lobster is a better deal! It was delicious, tasty, and big! They crack the meat from the claw so everything is super easy to eat. It came with a cognac sauce. For our sides, we ordered the creamed spinach and mac n cheese. Usually we order creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes, but we wanted to try a little something different. All the sides are good though. However, out of those, I would say the truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite. We did also try a side of their special menu, the pork belly with grits. I would have to say that I was disappointed with this... the grits were good, and I\\'m not a fan of grits. They were shaped and fried into triangular blocks and deep fried. That took it to another level and with the tomato sauce and pieces on top, it was delicious! I ordered this dish for the pork belly. That\\'s what sold me... however, there was only 3 tiny and I mean tiny pieces of pork belly on it!! This dish just was not worth it unfortunately. For dessert, we went with the banana cream pie to share. It was a big slice! It was not overly sweet and I really loved the pecan nut crust. I loved the crunch it added to the dish! The pie was very refreshing and seemed to clean out our palate well after our meal. Every time we have been here, they give you duck liver pate to start. I always look forward to that because it\\'s so light and delicious!! You get a handful of crispy bread to spread it on. It\\'s a great way to start the meal. Next comes the popovers, which is one of their specialties. You MUST try it, break it open, spread on some butter, and sprinkle a little bit of the salt they give you! It\\'s heavenly!! I have to stop myself from eating them all before the meal comes out because they are that good!! To end your meal, they also give you some small dessert bites. We were given little brownie bits. They were soft and chewy. A perfect addition to out banana cream pie!! Since we were celebrating our anniversary this time, they also gave us 2 glasses of champagne on the house to celebrate!\\n\\nWe love this steakhouse not only for the food, but also for the excellent service!! It has also been consistently good and the waiter really talks and jokes around with you. We have always had 5 star service here from start to finish each time. To find this place, walk towards the back of Bally\\'s. It\\'s past the Buca De Bupo and SEA. You do not hear any of the distractions of the slot machines and the ambiance is relaxing. \\n\\nWe\\'ll be back here again and again!! It\\'s must on every Vegas trip now!!	10	2	4

You also have some lemon, seaweed salad, tabasco, mignonette, and cocktail sauce.  This was pretty straight forward and tasted good, except the clams tasted a little too much like the ocean.\\n\\nFollowing the seafood platter, I ordered the trio of Sashimi: Roots, Shoots and Fruits\\n\\n    *  Fluke - Radish, Daikon Sprouts, Honeycrisp Apple\\n    * Snapper - Fresh Wasabi, Cilantro, Lemon\\n    * Hamachi - Red Beet, Sorrel, Chilled Grape 24\\n\\nI thought the Hamachi was the best of the trio.  Most places go spicy, by pairing a sliced Jalapeno with Hamachi, but Michael Mina went sweet with the roasted beet.  The others weren\\'t memorable.\\n\\nFollowing I order the trio of Surf and Turf - American Beef & Shellfish with a glass of Bordeaux\\n\\n    *  Kobe Ribeye - Grilled Lobster, Sauce Choron\\n    * Petit Filet - Crab \\"Oscar\\" Crust, Natural Jus\\n    * Langoustine - Bone Marrow, Langoustine \\"Bordelaise\\" 85\\n\\nThe Ribeye was well cooked and the lobster was fresh.  The Petit Filet was overcooked to a medium well(when I ordered medium rare).  The buttered lump Dungeness crab on top of the Filet was very\\ngood and went well with the steak.  I did ask the waiter to fire up a new one, which was also a little overcooked, but understandable because the Filet portion is so thin.  The waiter was very quick and attentive in giving new steaks, great service.  The Langoustine was cooked well and the bone marrow was deep fried with a little batter.  \\n\\nOverall, it was just ok, nothing really stood out and nothing was really terrible. I would recommend trying one of his preset or tasting menus, as I felt the Trios, priced similarly, weren\\'t worth it.	0	0	0

Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\\n\\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn\\'t the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\\n\\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\\"Would you like some more bread sir?\\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \\"Better!\\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\\n\\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\\n\\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\\n\\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.	2	1	1

She didn\\'t listen and got several drink orders wrong.  She also took up to 20 minutes before getting drinks and refills.\\n\\nThe food selection was abysmal.  And the taste was worse.

I only gave it a 4* rating because of the later part of the smoky part. \\n\\nWe had a lay over in Vegas on our way to Utah on vacation and the Hitching Post is also a motel RV park, so we lucked out they had a diner attached. \\n\\nAs I said when you walk in you immediately are blasted with smoke since you have to go through the bar to get to a room that is glassed off and a sensor you wave your hand in front of to open the sliding doors. The waitress asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or the dining room. We opted for the somewhat smokeless dining room. Wish we would of sat outside it would of been warmer. \\n\\nWe were promptly given menus and our drink order taken. No Dr. Pepper was not a plus for me. So I opted for coke that still tasted like coke from the gun in a bar. Otherwise there was a pretty nice menu to choose from. Usual diner options. Burgers, sandwiches, salads and steaks. \\n\\nI chose the grilled cheese with 3 types of cheese. Pepper jack, cheddar and Swiss on rye bread with sweet potato fries. My husband selected the chef salad with ranch dressing. Funny but our companions had exactly what we had. \\n\\nThe sandwich was perfectly toasted, not greasy. Fries were crispy and very good. The salads were full of ingredients and the boys really liked them. The only complaint I heard was they didn\\'t get any hard boiled egg on the salad as it said on the menu. \\n\\nThis place really did deliver a great meal at a great price and to our pleasant surprise our server asked if anyone in our party was military which there was and that just doesn\\'t happen. Kudos to them for the discount for our servicemen.	3	3	0

We had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\\n\\nThe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER.\\n- EMERIL\\'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\\n- GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren\\'t very tasty to me.\\n- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\\n- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn\\'t seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\\n\\nSides:\\n- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\\n- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\\n\\nAll in all, a great experience. We weren\\'t too full at the end of the meal, and didn\\'t have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\\n\\nHighly recommended!	4	1	2

Why do they make such a big deal about portion sizes when the burger basket is basically a Burger King size.  Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s filling af, but not to the degree that they try and sell it to you and market it to you.  Don\\'t waste your money here.  You are paying for the experience, and honestly, you can get the same amount of food at Burger King, same quality.  The manager won\\'t harass you for leaving a review on yelp and stare at you every time you walk by the establishment.  The Burger King manager doesn\\'t care.  Black bears manager?  Takes it personally and makes you feel sorry for having a bad experience.  Too bad.  \\n\\nIf you would like a place to hang out after Burger King, check out a coffee shop, go to the library, or take some yoga at RYK, right across the street.  You will spend the same amount of money (because black bear is over priced for its portions), and you will feel social:-))	2	2	1

I didn\\'t want to fall into the gimmick of paying more money for something just because it now comes in a different shape / form. Plus some places are stingy and will give you a tiny portion. Not Jaburritos! I shared the Redondo (ahi, salmon, yellowtail) with my boyfriend and was surprised by how full I got just eating half. The fish was fresh, and I was able to taste it in every bite (so it wasn\\'t just a bunch of fillers). Not bad for $13. It\\'s essentially the same price as a specialty roll.\\n\\nWe also ordered the sushi cupcakes. It came with 4: crab, smoked salmon, and 2 spicy tunas. The \\"cup\\" part is fried wonton skin, and the \\"cake\\" part is the seafood and rice. Pretty good, but a little too much sauce on all of them, so it was quite heavy. But kudos for creativity. Not sure how comparable other sushi burrito places are, but this was a great first experience!	1	1	1

For The Rice Shop it isn\\'t it\\'s premium location hidden in the burbs, it\\'s luxurious interior, or that its decorated from ceiling to floor in nonexistent fine antiques. The Rice Shop is great because it takes elements from many cultures, combines them together in a way that compliments each other, and executed nicely. No swooshes of weird green sauces, just plenty of greens to make up for that lack of daily vegetable serving. \\n\\nMy go to\\'s are the Mochiko chicken and Kentucky fried fish. There are less than 10 seats, it\\'s an one man army, everything is served in paper containers, and smells great.	6	5	6

Get the thai tea with the yelp special, it\\'s delicious! I followed the waiter\\'s advice and got the pad kee mow with chicken. Serving size was plentiful and the taste was exquisite. We sat in the beer garden. The misters kept me cool even in the 100+ degree weather and pants covering my legs.	0	0	0

But when you order papaitan, you get a lot of soup but not so much of meat. \\nPALABOK- 1/5 palabok without pork (only chicharon) and shrimp but with cabbage. It\\'s salty and expensive for the sauce, egg, noodles and chicharon. Lol! \\nThis place is a joke. Maybe pantawid gutom if you\\'re too hungry.	3	1	0

This is about the 4th Vietnamese restaurant that opened here since it\\'s inception. I call it the Death Corner. Previous restaurants have been good, but my theory is that the farther you move away from the strip, the higher the chance of failure. \\n\\nThis restaurant has all the right ingredients to make Vietnamese people happy. Good food. But that\\'s just it, good food doesn\\'t cut it when the majority of California Viets end up at Pho Kim Long because of proximity. What this place really need is a maitre d. \\n\\nAnyways, trust me, this is a good Vietnamese restaurant if you want good food. Let\\'s just leave it at that.	4	3	2

He was always a fan of the OG place on Highland Dr? The menu was pretty simple & they had good platter selections.\\n\\nMy only complaint was that our food wasn\\'t hot? It was warm, as if it\\'s been sitting out & they put it on a plate. I know I like my food to be steaming so I know that it\\'s fresh, or that they took the time to cook it, or that it was in a proper warming container. Just some food for thought.\\n\\nDrinks are $3, but it\\'s because the cups are also souvenir cups. They have Coke products, iced tea & a Keurig machine which was super fancy btw. \\n\\nNot a fan of all their sauces, but don\\'t take that into account I\\'m not much of a BBQ person.\\n\\nI ordered duo meat with sliced brisket & pork with a side of Mac n cheese & bacon potato salad (my favorite). Hubby had same duo meat combo w/ spare ribs & sliced brisket, sides were corn bread (tasted great, but dry) & waffle fries (had a sweet-ish taste). FIL got the whole beef ribs, which were huge but not fall-off-the-bone juicy & the baked potato with bacon, cheese, sour cream & green onions. And lastly, bro-in-law had a duo meat combo as well with corn bread & Mac n cheese.\\n\\nAll of the good tasted good, but I just wish it came out hot! Will try the OG place on Highland and compare.	0	0	0

We\\'ve eaten at most steak places in Las Vegas and wanted to try something new.  We were pleasantly surprised at our find in Bally\\'s of all places!  Service was fantastic, managers checked in multiple times, and the sommelier was superb and so helpful.\\n\\nThe complimentary duck patte and popovers were amazing!

Checked on Yelp and it has good ratings. \\n\\nService was at par. Claimed my two free egg rolls via the Yelp app. \\n\\nFood was so so... The egg rolls were fried to death. It was crunchy but dry inside. The nukmam sauce was very diluted with water. \\n\\nI had the pho with sliced meat, flank and tendons. The bowl had more meat than noodles (some people might like it but I like it to have more noodles). The flavor of the broth was so so. You can taste it has a lot of MSG. \\n\\nMy bf had a raw slice of beef in his pho. He said it was 2/5. \\n\\nNo next time for Kinh Do.	1	0	0

When I arrived in was still kinda crowded from the lunch rush,  and none of the tables looked bused yet.  The gentlemen in the front serving noticed me right away and cleaned off a table promptly.  \\nI ordered a plate of pad kea mow,  which is my favorite Thai dish.  I got my food quickly in less than ten minutes.  One thing I thought was strange was how the noodles used were not fat wide noodles that I usually see in the dish.  Instead they were similar to fettuccine noodles.  When asking how spicy I would like,  the waitress asked between one and five stars.  Now,  I\\'m used to them asking me in between one and ten,  so it took me a second to decide on my desired spiciness.  \\nI went ahead and went with a two.  \\nThe dish it\\'s self was still pretty spicy, and it was lacking some of the essential flavors I was looking for.  \\nAll and all,  it was a nice cheap and quick place for me to spend my lunch,  and I will probably be coming here again.	1	1	1

Nevertheless, I still expected decent Vietnamese food and service.\\n\\nWe had a table of 13 people and 2 kids. The waitress told us we can ONLY order soup entrees such as pho or bun bo hue. Someone from our table also ordered chicken wings, but it looked nothing like the picture of chicken wings displayed on the wall. The small order of pho was really lacking in flavor and noodles. I was still hungry after I ate everything! \\n\\nAnyways, never again.	0	1	0

I was so glad she found this restaurant.  It is on the Asian food strip on spring mountain.  However, it is little further down then most of the restaurants.  The restaurant is in the same plaza as a message place. \\n\\nThe restaurant was actually very clean.  Even the veggies that came with the food was very clean.  The bean sprouts were super white and the ends were picked off too! The servers were very nice.  There was a check in special for 2 free egg rolls.  I showed the server the coupon and he brought our whole table some egg rolls to share.  The egg rolls were delicious! I love egg rolls and usually have them at every restaurant I go to. These were awesome.  They used the Vietnamese wrappers which made the skin kind of chewy, and crunchy at the same time.  My sister and I liked it so much we ordered a full order.  \\n\\nMy sister had the pho and the broth was surprisingly very flavorful.  I had bun bo hue and it really hit the spot.  The broth was well flavored and spicy.  The meat was tender and they do give you a lot of meat.  There is only 1 size for all the noodles soups and it was a pretty big bowl.  \\n\\nOverall, a clean environment with good food and service! I will definitely come back the next time I\\'m in Vegas.	2	0	0

So instead of Fleming\\'s, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend\\'s bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\\n\\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\\n\\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\\n\\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\\n\\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I\\'ve seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\\n\\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\\n\\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\\n\\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\\n\\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden, \\nPicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.	1	0	0

But there\\'s a few things which make this Thai restaurant miss the mark for people who know real Thai food. \\n\\n1. Too sweet. In Thailand. Cooks add sugar to thai food to balance the sour and spice for tourists and it is a sign of a novice chef who is cooking to get a \\"yum\\" response and forgetting to aim for a \\"wow\\"\\n\\n2. No fish sauce. What Thai restaurant doesn\\'t have fish sauce on the table? That would have balanced the sugar. \\n\\n3. Portions. Massive, too big, we walked out feeling sick and only ate half. The flavour was lost in the kilogram of chicken. \\n\\n4. The prad kapow chicken normally comes with a fried egg on the rice, not the main. \\n\\n5. Not spicy, I had to add dried chilli flakes which is not Thai chili. I didn\\'t see Thai chilly except for s solid chilly. And everyone knows you chop and dice s chilly to balance the spice. Having a whole one hidden in your meal is a landmine if you\\'re not used to Thai spicy. \\n\\n6. I asked for the meal to be cooked as close to thai style as possible both in flavour and spice and it was neither flavourful or spicy. \\n\\nConclusion, if you want to get a hint of Thai food and you\\'re starving then its good. \\n\\nIf you want to taste Thai food, go somewhere else.	0	0	0

Their filet mignon, new york steak, and bone-in rib-eye were all done to perfections!  The cuts were thick yet so soft when you eat them.  Hats off to their chefs.  The steak were done so perfect you really don\\'t need to dip the meat in sauce or butter, etc.  It\\'s so flavorful as is.  Pricey?  Yes very.  Which is the only reason that might keep me from frequenting this restaurant as much as I would like to.  I don\\'t think they have a dress code.  But, I would recommend dressing up a bit when you go here.  Otherwise you would stand out and be embarrass like I was one time.  Happy eating!	0	0	0

I will publicly admit that I ate at Le Thai 3x last week for lunch because I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles w/ beef.

Well, good thing, since I don\\'t live there anymore, but this is even BETTER!!!!! Goodness gracious it is so good. It\\'s sweet, it\\'s spicy, the noodles are fresh, the beef is flavorful and tender....I get medium level spice and then just go to town on the Sriracha. 10 minutes later my nose is running and my ears are clogged, but it hurts so good!!!!!	3	2	3

I\\'m a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn\\'t taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that\\'s what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn\\'t finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \\n\\nNEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\\n\\nCAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It\\'s big enough to share with your entire party.\\n\\nBONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn\\'t wanna make a mess, that\\'s why I opted for boneless. I\\'ve got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn\\'t take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\\n\\nNOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\\n\\nFor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\\n\\nCan\\'t go wrong with Delmonicos.

We had a to-go order for a large party about 12 orders, so it was understandable that we still had to wait a minute for the order even though we called it in. \\n\\nI do like the variety of menu options, like coconut fried chicken and waffles! That ended up being a good order, the chicken was coated in shredded coconut and fried giving good texture and a light pop of coconut flavor. \\n\\nThe big breakfast burrito was odd though, it was more like a brunch burrito. The inside was breakfast burrito-ey, but outside it was drenched in red sauce like an enchilada?! It also came with beans and rice with some chips. Quite a meal, but not what you would expect. \\n\\nIf you have time do sit-in and enjoy the meal, but for busy people know that you have the option to just get it to-go.	2	1	1

The restaurant turned out to be quite spacious inside! Service was decent and friendly. The dimmed lighting and private booths created a nice, cozy atmosphere which made our experience highly enjoyable. \\n\\nWe were presented with toasty garlic bread which we all loved. I tried quite a few entrees. I thought the pasta da vinci, garlic noodles, and chopped salsbury steak were all unimpressive, but the fettuccine Alfredo and Kobe beef burger were both very delicious! The fettuccine\\'s creamy Parmesan sauce was very good, and the burger was a great value at just $12.99. Yum!\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae and the glazed strawberry cheesecake. Creamy and dreamy, both were very good!\\n\\nThis restaurant offers quality food and lovely ambiance at a very affordable price. Quite an ideal venue for a romantic date or special dinner with family or friends! \\n\\nMy only gripe was that the silverware was extremely dirty! I could literally wipe white film from my spoon and pick cookie crumbs from my fork... However, our server was nice enough to bring us new utensils AND wipe them down at our table for us, ha.	1	0	1

The meal was absolutely delicious.The Drucken Noodles were made to perfection and the heat was spot on. The service was impeccable, quick, and friendly. Even though it is located In Downtown Las Vegas /Fremont Street it should not detour you from stopping by and trying out this place. Small yet quant it has a atmosphere where you can go relax and enjoy a great meal. The  cocktails were also up to par. The Spring Rolls as well as the Fried Wings were amazing.

We stopped here for dinner before seeing Blue Man, enticed by the $20 three course meal option. Our server Jan was attentive, nice, funny, and super fast - great service to begin with but even more impressive because she was the only one working while we were there, so she was buzzing around a number of tables. \\n\\nOur food came promptly and was excellent - fresh crab cakes, perfectly cooked steak with creamy mashed potatoes, and decent chocolate cake that no one had room for. The food was certainly better than typical casino fare, though it alone wouldn\\'t get this rating to 5 stars. Jan was so awesome that anything less than 5 stars would be unfair.	0	0	0

Well it depends with what chain you will compare it with.\\nI would rank it just a bit over In and out Burger, but only cause you have more options here. The Burger are as well never frozen and deliciously prepared. The actual smashing is more a marketing trick to get a new burger chain on the market and visible. But that doesn\\'t really matter. You can taste that the burger are fresh and nicely grilled.\\n\\nI would have loved to have a chance to see when they are grilled and prepared as with its possible to most IN-out Burger locations. But it is not possible at least not at this location. I have to check others.\\n\\nBut that said i can finish it off with the verdict: it is simply a good burger for a fast food chain.\\nThis location near the UCLA ist clean and the service friendly.	1	1	1

I was impressed by the number of TV screens populating this sushi lounge. There wasn\\'t a place you could sit and NOT see the Packers beat the Bears. Plus, it wasn\\'t crowded. \\n\\nWe grabbed a quick bite from their $7 special menu, which is available everyday from 11:30am-5pm. From the $7 selection, we ordered a spicy California, spicy yellowtail and eel roll. I also snagged a seaweed salad. If you know me, you know I am not obsessed with sushi, and I am incredibly sensitive to the slightest little fishiness. I could not handle the yellowtail as it tasted fishy, which to me means probably not the freshest, as I have had yellowtail elsewhere and found it quite tasty. However, my husband, who isn\\'t as sensitive thought it was just fine. The California roll was made with imitation crab, and the overall balance was a little mushy. The seaweed salad was standard. I wouldn\\'t say this should be your one sushi meal or even a destination sushi meal, but if you happen to be at Mandalay and need a quick bite at a reasonable price, it will do ya.\\n\\nPersonally, I would go back to sip on a pot of green tea and watch some football.	11	5	10

With an excellent staff that gets you in a great mood and food that leaves your tastes buds more than satisfied,  you can\\'t go wrong with Blueberry Hill! This is my second time here and still haven\\'t been disappointed, if anything my visit this time was better than the last. Today we tried the \\"Chicken and Waffles\\" and \\"Chocolate OREO Pancakes\\"! Both of which were nothing short of delicious. Each has their own unique taste that keeps you wanting \\"one more bite\\" as long as you find yourself able to stomach the great portions that they give you, it shouldn\\'t be a problem at all. If you like chocolate and you like pancakes for breakfast the chocolate OREO pancakes are definitely the way to go! The OREO cookies and bits are cooked right into the pancake and topped off with a sauce that is what I beleive to be OREO cream itself! (if I am wrong please don\\'t tell me) and last but not least the chicken and waffles! This dish blended the sweetness of a dessert and hardiness of a breakfast meal. It caught me off guard with flavors that you would think to be very conflicting ones, turning it Into an epic combination of fulfillment and delight! I\\'d love to go on even more but that\\'s all for today, I will definitely be back to try more of the food they have to offer! It is well worth the visit!!!!!!!!!!	1	0	1

Over all it was all delicious. I also really enjoyed their cucumber drink, and it\\'s pretty affordable for $2 (I was able to refill it also, not sure how much that\\'s encouraged). The Starbucks and other place next door were $3+ for one small cup of juice, so I felt this place was a great buy.\\nI personally had no problem with the pita bread or anything else I ate here- I\\'m also usually pretty picky about chicken and I thought their chicken was Excellent.

It was my friend\\'s birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don\\'t actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \\n\\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d\\' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \\n\\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn\\'t have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don\\'t particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend\\'s fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don\\'t know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \\n\\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn\\'t overly impressed by them. \\n\\nMy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you\\'d be crazy not to come here!	2	2	2

I live near Fremont, and it\\'s a convenient place to grab some decent Thai food. Typically, I\\'d stop by once a week to grab some of their curry (which is pretty mild). The place is a bit crowded during peak hours, but usually isn\\'t too bad. \\n\\nHowever, lately I\\'ve been really busy so I\\'ve been ordering it for pick up -- a normal thing for a Thai place. And their absolutely poor service in this aspect has completely lost me as a long time and frequent customer. The first time I was on hold for 20 whole minutes, with someone picking up occassionally, asking what I needed, then after telling them it\\'s carry out, they\\'d say \\"One moment\\" while they try to grab someone. Now, I get that it\\'s busy and they can\\'t always take an order right away, but 20 whole minutes?\\n\\nThankfully, the manager gave me a free meal, but I rather have just paid for it if I could get my order. \\n\\nThe second time, the same thing happens. After fifteen minutes on hold, I just hang up. Whatever,  this time it was peak hours, I\\'ll just go down the street to Lotus of Siam who I never had a problem with.\\n\\nFinally, I try to order a third time on another day. And I get the same treatment. But this wasn\\'t during any crazy peak hours, so they don\\'t have much of an excuse. Fifteen minutes on hold listening to the most annoying hold music ever (8bit, high pitched melodies), I just hung up again.\\n\\nThere food is decent considering the location. However, just out of principle, I\\'ll never be returning. The amount of time I have to wait on hold with them, is the amount of time it takes round trip to pick it up elsewhere.	2	0	0

There wasn\\'t one customer in the restaurant, but that didn\\'t deter us from trying out their foods, since this restaurant had some pretty good reviews from fellow yelpers. I ordered their pho tai with raw beef on the side, spring rolls, com tam bi cha suon nuong (broken rice with grilled pork chop), and bun thit nuong (grilled beef with rice vermicelli and vegetable). We also received two free egg rolls for \\"Checking In\\" at their restaurant. The pho lived up to its top ranking, the broth was very flavorful, but they were a little skimpy on the noodles, IMO. My wife\\'s bun also did not have enough vermicelli in it and their fish sauce wasn\\'t as strong as some of the other restaurants in town, but not bad. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh as was their egg rolls. The pork chop with the broken rice dish was just okay. The eggs that were in this dish was quite good, but the pork chop needed more seasoning. If you come here, stick with the pho and spring/egg rolls.  After our meal, the owner brought out some Vietnamese dessert for us to try, on the house. This broken rice sweet dessert with taro and sweet potatoes were an absolute delight.  15% off my bill because I yelp. I definitely have to come back to try their $3 banh mi.	1	0	1

They didn\\'t even take it off the bill. We were harassed by some costumers to the point where we had to go sit outside. Food was average and way more then what it\\'s worth. Small portions big bill!	1	1	2

Bring your appetite with you!  If you\\'re eating in, they start you off with complimentary breadsticks, which is fried pizza dough flavored with garlic and sprinkled with parmesan cheese on top.  Delicious! If you\\'re really hungry, their deep dish pizza was good and one slice is enough to fill you up!  We ordered the meat classic deep dish and it had plenty of meat toppings but my favorite was the thick layer of chunky tomato sauce on top. We\\'ve tried their thin crust pizza, chicken parmesan, and balsamic chicken panini which have all been delicious.  Service has been great the times we\\'ve been there and they refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  We have since gone back for more!	1	0	0

Six of us came here today (as in I\\'m writing this from the table) and it took nearly an hour to get our meals. When our meals came out, one of the heuvos rancheros was really undercooked. We sent the meal back and it took another 20 minutes to get it back. Although the manager came over, he didn\\'t apologize or anything. He just said, it will be out in two minutes...and it took another 8-10. In addition to this debacle, drinks took forever to come out and they forgot to give us basic condiments like syrup for our french toast. This was a really horrible experience. I think the manager and our waitress (Patricia A.) should be fired for incompetence and poor customer service.	0	0	0

Pretty good food, but the prices are a tad expensive ($10 for Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, or Pad-See-Ew) but I can understand because of it\\'s location right across from Insert Coins.  However, I do like the food though; it\\'s well made with just the right amount of spice (fyi the spice level is from 1-5 with 2 being medium). If you are going for take out this place usually takes about 20-30 min. to prepare food, but it\\'s worth the wait in my opinion. Highly recommend shrimp Pad-See-Ew and Shrimp Drunken Noodles ($2 extra for shrimp). Great place for lunch!!	0	0	0

I chose this menu because of the scallops.  The other two people I was dining with chose the signature tasting menu (which looked way better).  If you decide to dine here skip the seasonal menus as the 83rd or a scallop is a joke and the rest of the meal was substandard.  Additionally they attempted to pair a rose with one of the tastings and all I can say is that it was not paired well and I question if the sommelier even tried the wine and dish beforehand.  This meal was a typical strip rip off and I am severely disappointed in the meal and question if I would ever go back.	0	0	0

This is a great restaurant to bring out of town friends to, or if you\\'re in Vegas for the weekend and want a unique meal. It\\'s a huge meal (literally 6 courses) and there\\'s a ton of variety. Plus they are extremely accommodating for those with dietary restrictions - vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, shellfish allergy etc. Just let them know when you make your reservation and they\\'ll take care of you.

Most of the reviews raved about the calamari steak, so of course, we had to try it! We ordered the calamari steak appetizer and it was easily one of the best things I\\'ve eaten in a long time. Not only was it delicious,  but it was also very beautifully presented. \\nNow, on to the main dishes... My husband ordered the chicken tagine.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the sauce was so yummy. I ordered the chicken brochette,  which is basically a kabob.  Once again, the chicken was tender and juicy and the spices that it was cooked with gave it a great flavor. It also came with saffron rice, potatoes and an incredibly yummy tomato topped with parmesean cheese and spices. For dessert,  we ordered the panna cotta. It had a great citrus flavor and was very refreshing- the perfect ending to an amazing meal!\\nWe also ordered a bottle of the Moroccan wine, which perfectly complimented the flavors of our meal. At $45/bottle,  it was totally worth it.\\nThe staff was just as great as the food. From the host who greeted us at the door to the waiter to the owner, everyone was so friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  \\nWe are already looking forward to going back!

The staff is always friendly over the phone, the food doesn\\'t take to long to get to me, and the delivery driver is always super friendly. I feel the prices are reasonable as well. \\n\\nI always get chicken pad thai with a side of white rice. I am not disappointed by it, it certainly kills my pad thai cravings, but its not my absolute favorite pad thai. Their excellent customer service here (that I have experienced anyway) certainly makes up for that. And for that reason, is why I keep going back.\\n\\nSee you soon Sin City Thai Restaurant!	0	0	0

After a disappointing attempt to get my bbq fix on the other day I finally got it on here.  You can pretty much get bbq at any buffet around town but this is my usual spot with the buffet at south point. Beef and pork bbq ribs, brisket please.  They have other food also but I\\'m here for bbq overload.  Also recommend their variety of ice cream flavors. \\n\\nMaybe the cheapest All Day buffets in town, you can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner as many times you want ALL DAY LONG and it\\'s only $24.99.  Dinners by it self starts at 13.99. \\n\\nI would not recommend their Friday seafood buffet the crab are thinly sliced and not much difference between the regular days other then the price. Try another place if your looking for a Friday seafood buffet as almost every buffet in town have a Friday seafood special	1	0	0

They include the soup & salad bar and the Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Mongolian Barbecue, American, Seafood, BBQ and the dessert bar.\\n\\nI have eaten here many times. The food is not outstanding but there is plenty of variety and I can always find things here that I like. The salad bar recently had marinated artichoke hearts which is a big plus for me. The beef ribs are meaty, tender and flavorful. And you can gorge yourself on the shrimp and crayfish. And numerous other offerings keep me returning. I found the dessert bar to be just so-so but overall it\\'s a good buffet. And I\\'d have to say that the prices make it one of the best buffet values in town. If you present a B-Connected card which is free from the Orleans casino, you\\'ll save an extra dollar on the buffet. The same card is valid at all Boyd Gaming properties.	3	0	0

The servers/staff on the other hand has gotten to be a problem.  On my last two visits, I got some major shade/attitude from the lady making the orders.  One example:  I ask for some chopped cucumbers and tomatoes in my Chicken Plate.  She replies \\"that\\'ll be an extra charge because the salad mix already has cucumbers and tomatoes.\\"  In the past, I\\'ve never been given this answer.  Plus, there were like 2 tiny cubes of cucumber and 1 itty bitty piece of tomato in the salad portion.  My entire chicken plate experience was like this.   Note to management:  teach your employees to be kinder...a happy customer is worth 10000x more than an ounce of veg.\\n\\nThe food is good, but at times I feel they\\'re trying to nickel and dime you on every topping.  Additional advice to management:  Arrange the damn ingredients in a way to CLEARLY show which cost extra....OR just don\\'t charge extra for these things.  Your customers will be grateful for that and make return visits.  It costs you so little for these ingredients. #bereal	1	0	0

After talking with the owners they told me about some other great silly menu items but we decided on the Kentucky Fried fresh and the lumpia.

There is paid on-street parking not too far from the restaurant (if you\\'re driving there and not staying someplace downtown). \\n\\nIt was well worth the trip. I had the short rib fried rice and my wife had the pad thai, both of which were excellent. We also shared the Waterfall Beef appetizer, which was also delicious. The prices are very reasonable for being downtown and they had some pretty good happy hour specials (M-F from 3-6) too. The service was also good. Everyone was attentive and friendly. \\n\\nThere are a few downsides to know about if you decide to come try it out. One, it\\'s super small. They have a takeout window up front so you can conveniently get it to go, but I\\'d be surprised to hear if the max capacity was any more than 40 people. So if you go when it\\'s busy, expect a wait. Two, there are only 2 or 3 tables inside (plus the bar); everything else is outdoor seating. However, I will admit that it was over 100 degrees the day we went and the beer garden (aka an enclosed rear courtyard with a canopy and misters) was surprisingly comfortable.	0	0	1

I really enjoy my share of seafood so I was all for this. My husband and I came in from LA. We weren\\'t really hungry so we opted for this place. It was a warm night with a bit of Vegas breeze/wind, so we sat outside. It gave us a nice view of the pool and we were semi shielded from too much wind. There was a good bunch of people out. The music was perfect. The blend of mellow but up beat Vegas. \\n\\nWe only ordered the crab cake, some drinks, and the seafood platter for two (or smaller of the two versions). The crab cake was okay. It wasn\\'t my favorite among the ones we\\'ve had. It was citrusy and.. pushed the freshness of the crab out of the food. I didn\\'t enjoy it. My husband says the cake was a three but he wouldn\\'t order it again. \\n\\nThe platter on the other hand, I\\'d order that again! It was fresh, well worth it and the kitchen did a lot to accommodate the people who are unfamiliar with cracking/de-shelling. The dish came with lobster, shrmip/prawns, oysters and I think that\\'s it? It doesn\\'t sound like much but definitely filled us up and we left happy. \\n\\nI\\'d be happy to try this place again. :)	0	0	0

I dined with my husband hoping for authentic Italian cuisine and sadly, we were SO disappointed. Our appetizers were still frozen inside. When our waiter came to check on us, I told him about the mozzarella sticks. His response,\\"Oh. Uh. Uh. Do you want me to take these back?\\" It was really hard to notice his disgust and sarcasm in his response. We already ordered a pizza, which we were told would take 45 minutes, so we waited in hopes of it being delicious. When he brought it to us 45 minutes later, it was cold ...and just gross. Another notable observation; The waiter NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE. Not to check on us. Not to refill drinks. Nothing. We had to go to the hostess stand to get our bill. The food was just awful, as was the customer service. Believe me, we will never come back.	4	0	1

Not the best steak in Vegas.\\n\\nThree of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don\\'t believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I\\'ve had 10\\'s before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn\\'t make it so.\\n\\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four. Creamed spinach, always a favorite of mine and recommended by the waiter, was just odd and bland - didn\\'t taste interesting or flavorful at all. The best side was the asparagus, but honestly, how hard is it to steam asparagus?\\n\\nDesert, as it often is at these kind of places where desert is an afterthought, was disappointing and ended the overall experience on a \\"blah\\" note.\\n\\nWine list was excellent.\\n\\nWith so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately.	0	0	0

But.. they are amazing.\\nVine rippen tomato salad, really good.  cheese was super fresh and the tomatos were very sweet and rip.  \\nRib Eye - was perfectly cook, medium rare.  perfect crust and was just so good.  \\nI can see why my friends made it a tradition to come here.	0	0	0

Really good but didn\\'t blow my socks off. Third time I wanted to try a noodle soup dish but decided to stray away from my usual. I ordered the bun bo hue. The flavors were really good and melded together well but I think it was overly seasoned and slightly too thick. It was a heavier stew than what I am used to with this dish. My son had the combination fried rice. We have had fried rice in every Viet restaurant in Vegas and I would say by far, this one would be in the top 2. \\n\\nToday on this cold night I ordered a bowl of pho. It was slightly sweeter than I remembered but still good as is evident in my empty bowl. I ordered the banh mi thit nuong and a thai tea to go. When I finally tried the banh mi I was so impressed! Even as a cold sandwhich I was so happy to finally find a good banh mi in this town. The pork was a thicker cut but so incredibly tender and flavorful. It is reminiscent of a Thai beef jerky a while back but way more unctious and tender.  It is quite obvious that the marinade is comprised of many different ingredients that make it so complex that my mind and tastebuds were trying to catalogue what was all in it. Lemongrass is definitely a top ingredient that makes the meat so fragrant.  This is so beyond fish sauce and sugar like some other places :-/ The mayo seemed fresh, the pickled veggies and fresh greens just put it over the top. I\\'m so glad I finally got the banh mi. Now I know where to get them from now on!	2	0	0

He had an order of the Miso Ramen, though not traditional, was still very tasty. I had the Bahn Mi Burger... Outstanding! Bun was killer and the meat and other fixins was on point.\\n\\nService was good, though it was busy and seemed a little short staffed. For just the 2 of us we had a 30 min wait @ 1PM. No big deal, it was a holiday so I get it. \\n\\nI do look forward to coming back and trying more!	0	0	0

-jHJ2K8AkCVl3FdgfiNV5Q	-Le6cwbZL4tDZwNHwipfKg	OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA	3	2010-11-21 00:00:00-08	For the record, I went here last Saturday, November 13th.\\n\\nSo this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I\\'m not too into planning dates, because, well, that\\'s not my job as a woman. James hadn\\'t been to Nevada so he wasn\\'t much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he\\'d pick the cuisine and I\\'d pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn\\'t really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn\\'t just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.\\n\\nWell, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I\\'ve driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro\\'s but in actuality, it\\'s a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.\\n\\nI literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn\\'t quite middle eastern but it\\'s really similar - or just enough so that it doesn\\'t much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn\\'t, and they sat us anyway, which wasn\\'t a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it\\'s very dark, so you don\\'t have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don\\'t feel as if you\\'re being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. \\n\\nWe were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I\\'m 5\\'9 and James is 6\\'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I\\'m a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. \\n\\nJames and I were given a wine menu but we didn\\'t order any booze and we weren\\'t offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That\\'s about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. \\n\\nHmmmm... I\\'m not sure how \\"Moroccan\\" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it\\'s a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. \\n\\nThe next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.\\'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*\\n\\nThe crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. \\n\\nThe next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn\\'t the greatest but it wasn\\'t a big deal. \\n\\nWe didn\\'t eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. \\n\\nThe dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.\\n\\nHonestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don\\'t think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let\\'s be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don\\'t know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I\\'ll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that\\'s really what it\\'s all about.	4	1	3

She first asked for address to verify if it was in delivery range. Then tells me to hold... so I wait... and i wait...and i wait... then.. beep beep (dial tone). Hm... so it could just be a mistake.. so I call back. And say u hung up on me.... and in the middle of explaining my self she says you hung Up. It\\'s ok. What was ur phone number again.. so I laughed it up and decided to order again.. I ordered a quite of few things but not all what I wanted. Because the girl has like a problem with me ordering food or something. And kept rushing me by saying anything else with a pity attitude.. I mean come on.. don\\'t u want ur business to get as much sales as possible.? Why rush me? So I\\'m giving it two stars because I don\\'t know how the food is. Or else it would be a 1 star. Get with the program hostess phone person.... sheesh...	0	0	0

The hostess needs more training or her post was not visible for the customer. If she said Hello at least we were able to notice her and schedule our lunch. Instead, she yelled to my daughter half way inside. Of course I said NO, when she asked if I wanted to schedule lunch. There are more better Thai Restaurants in Vegas, one is Arawan in E. Sahara, 5 star, highly recommended.	0	0	0

The lines can be crazy on the weekends though! One of the cheapest places to eat Vegas IMHO. The portions are so big you can share. If you sit on the patio you\\'ll have a front row seat to the show above the aquarium. \\n\\nSome of my favorite appetizers are the Roadside Sliders, Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and the Firecracker Salmon. \\n\\nMy favorite specialties are the Ranch House Burger, Steak Diane and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club. \\n\\nMy favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!  \\n\\nMy favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t offer a kid\\'s menu in the past but now do. It\\'s for kids 10 and under and includes a drink (choice of a soft drink, milk, apple juice or lemonade) \\n\\nThis is what is offered:\\n\\nRoadside Sliders \\nFried Chicken Sliders \\nMini Corn Dogs \\nPasta with butter & Parmesan cheese \\nwith Marinara sauce \\nwith meat sauce \\nwith Alfredo sauce  \\nKids Quesadilla \\nwith chicken  \\nMac & Cheese \\nChicken Strips w/ fries \\nCheese or Pepperoni Pizza  \\nGrilled Cheese with fries \\nGrilled Chicken Breast with potatoes and a vegetable  \\n\\nDesserts are: \\nIce Cream  \\nMini Hot Fudge Sundae  \\nKid\\'s Strawberries\\n\\nInsider Tip: They also offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread.	2	0	2

It\\'s one of those hole-in-the-wall precious places you only tell your friends about since you don\\'t want the line out the door kind of selfish thing. But then again I am yelping about it. Both the food and drinks are authentic and made with time and care. (This is not a speedy place if you want efficiency) It\\'s a layback place where you are invited to play cards or board games and imagine you are back in a small town in Asia. The boba surpasses any spot in town and absolutely worth the wait. All the rice dishes are just as delicious and true to the traditional setups as in Asia. The stew pork rice is almost as good as grandma\\'s! Only bring your family, good friends and slow time.	0	0	0

There were probably 7 or eight tables full with customers.  The décor is a zero.  Looks like they just moved into a four wall spot and just put a sushi bar and some tables in there.  The ceiling looks unfinished as they didn\\'t put a drop down ceiling at all which I think would help the look of the place. Definitely don\\'t be expecting an ambiance.  \\n\\nWe ordered edemame, ebi, spicy California roll and chicken fried rice.  Everything was really good.  The fried rice had slivers of almond in it which was different but really tasty.  I\\'m not sure if I have ever had almonds in my fried rice but it was a unique touch. I might just come back for that alone!  \\n\\nThe service was an \\"eh\\". An older woman was our server and seemed to be the only one working the tables and she didn\\'t seem all that friendly or maybe she just didn\\'t know English very well.  Minus the ambiance and service, the food was good and we will for sure give it another whirl just for the eats. ;)	3	2	1

They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I\\'m not sure if they follow food safety protocols.	0	0	0

The food was amazing too. I had the Yellow Chicken Curry (the BEST curry I\\'ve ever had) and my husband had the Short Rib Fried Rice, which he said was fantastic.

If you get one of the good servers you will have hot food, excellent service and a great time. I\\'d recommend Mary, Margarita, Stephanie and at night-time Kendall. Avoid Nancy at all costs! At this place the server makes all the difference in the world. Pancakes are fluffy, the ham and cheese omelet has top quality ham and cheese, so much better than IHOP or Denny\\'s. I also love the Italian meatloaf.	1	0	1

I\\'ve been going regularly since they opened and I\\'m always quick to introduce friends to the place.  Another one of those restaurants that sort of hides in plain sight, it sits quietly next to the Commonwealth on Fremont Street between 6th and Las Vegas Blvd.\\n\\nThe menu is relatively small, but has something for most fans of Thai food.  Everything is cooked fresh, the food is delicious, and you can choose how how you\\'d like your dish to be.  Portions are just the right size for lunch and dinner.  If you order a bowl of soup though, you may end up taking some home.  You truly get a bowl of soup, but it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nThe wait staff is super friendly.  Seating is limited (some indoors and some covered on the patio in the back), and a little bit at the bar, so get there when they open, or be prepared for a small wait.  Even if you have to wait though, seats seem to open up quick enough so that the wait isn\\'t usually too bad.  And for those interested, you can see into the kitchen!\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have something already in mind, try the Awesome Flat Noodles, Ga Pow or Pad Prik with a Thai Iced Tea.  The Cucumber Salad is a fantastic side dish.  Just go.  You\\'ll thank me later.	1	0	2

I went on a Thursday night and they had a muscial jazz band playing. Along with the hot off the pot dishes, the \\"family feel\\" service, and the decent prices you pay for such a large amount of food, you really can\\'t go wrong! Also this place is run by a Filipino couple, so if you have your parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles to bring, this place is the place they will sure to enjoy! Can\\'t wait to go back! \\n\\nFood tip: Try their sisig and sinigang! The best!	0	0	0

The waiter is very kind and we took his recommendation of banana cream cheesecake. \\n\\nAlso really like the pre-dinner bread. It\\'s black bread coated with oat and honey, warm, and served with butter. Sooooo good!\\n\\nShrimp pasta is good. But not as impressive as the above two. Otherwise I would give five stars. Shrimps are big and fresh, properly cooked, but besides shrimp, there\\'s only tomato and red pepper in the pasta. It\\'ll taste better if more veggies like onion, broccoli, mushroom etc could be added.	0	0	0

And this place did a good job of that. I\\'m not a huge Pho\\' fan, but she liked it a lot, so the marks are high. The place was very popular with the locals in this small asian community so that\\'s a good sign too. I\\'m not normally a big fan of Vietnamese cuisine, but it was inexpensive and fresh and just what we needed before the drive!\\n\\nAnd be sure to try their egg rolls. Unique and amazing.	1	0	1

It was just bread and meat and some kind of sauce. I like my sandwiches with different things inside. Since it was just meat... I got bored of it pretty quick. Sandwich was big so it was worth it if you\\'re a meat lover and you like those kinds of sandwiches I guess.\\n\\nIf I ordered something better it might have been a bit better. My friend got a tuna sandwich and she liked it. Others got some kind of southwest(?) sandwich and they liked it too. So they had a good experience with the food here :)\\n\\nSo I guess it really depends. I liked the inside of the place too. Pretty big, lots of place to sit. BUT, long wait for our food. We went at 2:30 because we woke up very late and so no one was really here. But the wait for food was ridiculously long.	2	1	0

But then again, you\\'re comparing $45 to $15. Lines are never to long for the buffet, even during prime dinner time. Most days, there are prime rib that is decent. Succulent meat and taste is there. I also like eating their shrimp with cocktail sauce here. Unlike some other buffets in Vegas, the cocktail shrimp here taste fresh and have that good seafood taste. I do enjoy the simpler American side dishes here. Mac and cheese, baked beans, mashed potatoes, etc. Dessert is nice as well. They have a gelatin bar that they serve you and cheesecake is creamy with a good crust. \\n\\nDon\\'t bother with the Chinese food. Maybe I\\'m super critical because I\\'m Chinese, but that hot and sour soup is a joke -  taste nothing like it. Egg rolls inside is too soggy.\\n\\nI give this 3 stars because for $15 and the lack of waiting in line, it\\'s hard to beat in Vegas. As long as you enter knowing full well what you paid, you\\'ll have a good time.	3	1	1

We had a few drinks in the room and decided to come here before going out to the club and ordered the \\"Fish Bowl\\". That\\'s what we started calling it. It\\'s real name is Electric Fiesta Bowl. This thing is amazing. It tastes great and knocks you on your ass. We have now made it tradition to get these bad boys every time we hit Vegas. If you want to take it on the strip they give you little pitchers. Which pull ladies, let me tell you. They are always curious to know what it is and where you got it.

I\\'ve been going here once or twice a month for over a year and no one recognizes me (which isn\\'t a big deal) Servers are friendly(sometimes),but most don\\'t speak English very well so it makes it hard to order sometimes. Also make sure you sit close to the bar because once they give you your order they will not check on you to see how you are doing or even to just refill your drink and it can be hard to get someone\\'s attention. I get the Awaze tibs which is beef and peppers. I would recommend this for anyone that isn\\'t very adventurous with food but wants something delicious! I\\'ve tried other places but this is the best as far as food quality. Also food is cheap for how much you get. Great place for dates!!	0	0	0

Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \\n\\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \\n\\nFood-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\\n\\nThe cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT\\'s version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.	0	0	0

I haven\\'t heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \\n\\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn\\'t too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn\\'t finish it. \\n\\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn\\'t able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn\\'t complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn\\'t order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \\n\\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \\n\\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.	2	0	1

I kept trying different foods hoping to get some redemption, but nothing.  The turkey tasted a little rubbery, the chicken was burnt and even the desserts were not very good,  The overall selection, as the quality, has been reduced it appears since I was here last. To add insult to injury, I had to wait 30 minutes (and that\\'s in the M Life line) for this bland journey.	0	0	0

We were initially shooting for Bachi Burger but the crowd was a little insane. So I go into Shoku and ask them if they could do a vegetarian broth and yes, they knew exactly what I was talking about. \\n\\nI\\'m going to go out on a limb here that miso soup...is not my favorite. So when the 2 veggie options were miso or spicy miso, I was rather underwhelmed. I went for spicy miso as it just sounded way more interesting. \\n\\nThe bowl I received was exquisite. It was beautiful...deep red spicy broth, perfectly boiled ramen noodles and a mish mash of exotic vegetables. I added their buttered corn and boy was that a tasty little surprise! I am such a fan. Flavorful and hearty. My lunch was perfect.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small but so charming...like right out of Japan. The wait staff are extremely friendly. Prices are OK (about $9 for a bowl). Food is excellent. \\n\\nI will definitely be back for some of that Spicy Miso Ramen (with buttered corn please).	4	1	2

I mean 90% of the meat is the fat.. on top of the mayo and sunny side up, I\\'m pretty sure ur cholesterol will go up.! hardly any meat or any other ingridients for sisig... it was just nice looking in color with peppers but the flavor and the quality is poor!!! very poor.. then we ordered the lechon kawali pork bellywith Java garlic rice, again the rice was salty and the pork/meat not crispy at all the skin!!! that\\'s Lechon kawali! it\\'s supposed to be crispy. and of course it\\'s bathing in the oil even though I asked them to drain it well... the skin of the pork is so thin and not crispy or crunchy!!! more like hard to bite skin... the sauce is ok. and the rice was very salty again. so there you go. u decide if u still want to try their food. i hope they are consistent with the quality and flavor because if not this resto will not last a long time, I\\'d give it a couple more months if it continues to be like this. am I coming back? not anymore. just disappointed and just dnt want to make that trip wasted. if it\\'s just one food has the problem it should be ok. but all 3 of them scores 1 out of 10 for me! so I hope my review helps U decide!	0	0	0

Well, whatever you do, don\\'t! \\nOur server was HORRIBLE! She was so ridiculously slow & NEVER came to check on us unless we flagged her down. Which I had to do often because their cups are so tiny, you take 2 sips & your drink was gone. \\nThe food was sub-par. I ordered the Irish Benny - all was good except the English muffin was so soggy I didn\\'t even want to eat it.\\n\\nAs for ambience, looks, & cleanliness? Well, I give it a 4/10. As an example, I sat on the booth & the thing was broken so it flipped up & almost knocked me to the floor (I am a VERY thin person, so fat jokes don\\'t apply here). \\n\\nNot a place I will be going again.	0	0	0

However, once I found this hole in the wall, hard to miss location with it\\'s huge sign, I found a very unpretentious place to enjoy an amazing beer, or two, or three (actually, I had five the day of my visit). \\n\\nThe beers come from all over...though they don\\'t have many taps and virtually no bottles, all the beers are great!!! \\n\\nThe wait staff is friendly, though not always knowledgeable about what is on tap...but who cares. All I need my wait staff to do is pour the beer, hand it to me, and then leave me alone as I sip and enjoy. \\n\\nI also had lunch here, which is not recommended unless you really love bar food (I do not!). Some items on the menu seem over priced, but you could care less if you\\'re hungry and need something to wash down all that beer with!!!\\n\\nIf you love beer and have time to drive off the strip, make sure to visit Aces and Ales!	4	0	4

We sat at the bar ordered a margarita for her and a beer for myself along with 2 Don Julio shots, after about 13 minutes my wife told me she couldn\\'t feel her feet! (Uh-Oooh little did we know we\\'d be there for another 3 hours) After a few more shots we moved to a table for waiter service because we now had the munchies.  He informed us of the shot specials that had the bartender told us about we would\\'ve saved money, oh well live and learn.  I remember the food being pretty good but I think its safe to say I was buzzed and my wife was trying to figure out who I was.  We had about 12 top shelf shots, 1 mixed drink and 2 beers between us, the walk back to the room was challenging. To this day my wife says she felt fine the next day and didn\\'t have much of a hangover, then I remind her she didn\\'t wake up till 5PM the next day.... we still talk about that place. I\\'d give it 6 stars if I could because it was fun and has a great selection of Tequila, who cares if the place looks boring and It doesn\\'t have the feel of a nightclub. Go with the right person you\\'ll have a great time.	0	1	0

Frozen and hungry, we were searching for something warm and spicy. We found Le Thai, a small and casual gem. Tiny dining area, so we had to eat outside in jackets in a screened patio area with heaters( a small inconvenience). I eat Thai often(NY, NJ), but this was one of the best and even slightly unique. The Penang curry tasted like homemade- mild and creamy, and transparent flavors(no mystery sauces). Kee Mao was not sticky like other places but actually juicy and refreshing with all the veggies. I also had a salad, I think pork with lettuce and dressing...forgot the name, but was nice and lemony. However, they missed the soooo delicious peanuts. They should consider adding them for another layer of flavor and texture.\\nThai iced tea could have used less brewing or steeping time, it was a bit bitter.\\nThumbs up Le Thai!\\nOh, a little fun fact: all their menu sections are prefixed with Le. So it will say Le Beverage, Le other Beverage, Le Salad. I found it amusing and nice.	0	0	0

Came in, were sat immediately, and then waited around 15 minutes to order, which was seriously annoying, especially as almost everyone who got seated after us were able to order first.  I had the spicy miso ramen, extra spicy, and they weren\\'t kidding, it was spicy, but that\\'s ok, I\\'m a bit of a chili head.  The waitress told us that some people thought it was too salty, so she recommended getting hot water on the side.  I didn\\'t think it really needed it, but I used it anyway, and the full flavor was still there.  The noodles were cooked well, but I wish there had been more of them.  I finished them way before I was even halfway through the broth.  Overall, meal was fine, but I think there are better ramen restaurants around town.\\n\\nFood = 3 stars\\nService = 2.5 stars\\nAmbiance = 3 stars	0	0	0

Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \\n\\nWe ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre \\'d. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I\\'m a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!\\n\\nFor dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril\\'s shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!\\n\\nThis is a place you probably wouldn\\'t wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it\\'s best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\\n\\n*Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!	1	0	0

That\\'s quick turnaround for fresh food, and you can really taste the quality. I got the mochiko chicken and loved every bite; it was wonderfully crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce that was in the dish was well done and not overpowering, adding enough flavor that it really helped turn the meal into something great. Delicious!\\n\\nThe menu is relatively small, but that\\'s not a negative to me: whatever you\\'re in the mood for is probably covered. Chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork, fish, and beef are all available (in one item each) with their own complementing sauces and vegetables.\\n\\nChef Tony was very friendly and focused on service, which is fantastic for a place he seems to run solo. I\\'ll definitely be coming back again and again! For the price (about $9) this place is a must-try.\\n\\nThe only thing I\\'m not sure about is vegetarian options, which is important for me since my wife is a vegetarian.

The service is quick and they\\'ll adjust your drinks if needed. I really wish they had the plastic sheets like other boba places. They use a soda cap for their cups, so I cant turn the up upside down to shake it. \\n\\nThe almond milk tea is pretty good, a bit on the sweet side. The other flavored drinks aren\\'t as sweet. \\n\\nOverall its a contender for Boba. Definitely on par with Kung Fu Tea and Tea Station. It\\'s worth a visit.	0	0	0

We had a reservation at 7:30 and were promptly seated.  I love when you have a reservation and you actually get seated right away. \\nAnyway, the decor is very elegant, but not too gaudy or overdone.  Definitely felt like a Bellagio restaurant.\\n\\nAlthough they have a \\"tasting menu\\" that seemed pretty good for the price, Kristin C. and I opted for selected our own entrees.  We started with the steak tartare salad and I ordered the sashimi plate.  The steak tartare salad was pretty good although they could have put less steak and more vegetables.  The sashimi was good, but it wasn\\'t amazing.  For our main courses, we got the lobster pot pie and Mediterranean grill plate.  The lobster pot pie is one of their signature dishes and it definitely did not disappoint.  The lobster pieces were generous.  The Mediterranean plate was pretty good, but it wasn\\'t amazing.  It had grilled calamari and prawns, but it wasn\\'t anything to write home about.\\n\\nThe big winner in my mind, however, was the black truffle potato puree.  Anything with truffles is a win in my book, and that puree was no different.  It was creamy and had the right amount of flavor. Delicious.\\n\\nIn the end, without any beverages, our bill came out to $199 without tip.  Kinda pricey, but not too bad for a fancy meal.	1	1	1

I\\'ve never had Ethiopian food before and they were very helpful in teaching me how to eat the enjera.\\n\\nFood: I ordered the \\"Chicken and Egg\\" dish with enjera, which was AMAZING. The best way i can describe it is that it tastes like curry, but not as spicy.  My friends ordered the Beef and Lamb tibs, which came sizzling on a hot plate.  Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Portions are huge.\\n\\nI wish there was one in Southern California.\\n\\n*My opinion may be a little biased because my mouth (and wallet) were still sour from an incredibly underwhelming and just as incredibly over priced meal at Bouchon at The Venetian the night before.

Since it was only 8:30 in the morning on a tuesday I thought breakfast was calling out to me. People do say its the most important meal of the day. I guess my package can wait. Priorities right? Bacon usually takes it over almost anything.\\n\\nSo I go in and am shocked to discover the place was packed. I guess people do eat breakfast eh? Anyways, as I took a quick glance on their menu, I noticed the only thing that had bacon in it was the Spinach, Egg, and Bacon Panini. So, that\\'s my order. It cost me about 6 bucks and some change. I was thinking wow, that is a bit pricey for a panini.\\n\\nWaited about 10 minutes. When I got it, the sandwich was about the size of an Earl\\'s sandwich, about 6 inches. Basically it was two small sandwiches put together. You had scramble eggs mixed with spinach and some bacon. It was ok but for the price and portion size, not worth it. Maybe I should of stuck to bagels. LOL.\\n\\nIn closing, I think next time I will just get a bagel or two and put some shmear on it. Weird name for their spreads but oh well, its pretty good.\\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #156 \\"E=MC2? Nope, it means the paninis are pricey here\\	1	3	1

I\\'d say the quality is just average, but I really enjoyed the range and imagination that went into the menu. \\n\\nMy husband went with a basic bleu cheeseburger and fries. Dad and I got the Mac & cheeseburger and a BBQ Chicken pizza to share. Again, good portions and creativity. Ok quality. \\n\\nFor dessert - brownie bread Pudding and a chocolate peanut butter shake. The latter wasn\\'t very thick, but had tons of flavor. And the bread pudding is probably croissant bread pudding with chunks of brownie on top (which they forgot and promptly brought out) as well as ice cream. \\n\\nThis was a fun place to visit with family. As anything on the Strip, it was over priced. But very fun!	3	2	4

They also offer good discount deals for their player\\'s club members. The lines can get long if you come right at the peak of service (like 9am for breakfast; noon for lunch; or 6pm for diner).\\n\\nThey\\'ve got the various food stations based on either type of food or region.  BBQ, seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. Two salad bar stations and a center desert island with cakes, pastries and ice cream round out the mix. \\n\\nThe servers are all busy, efficient and make multiple stops by your table to fill drinks and take away plates as you grub your way through your meal session. \\n\\nSome of the food is decent, some you\\'ll pass on depending on freshness and others you won\\'t even touch.

I don\\'t know if we came at the wrong time or what... But it was mediocre asssfff. The food was OK... The mac & cheese bites were the best thing that we ordered. The service was crappy. Dude was nice and all but we literally watched him stand in the middle of the dining room floor texting. Not a good look. The drink is obviously supposed to be sweet and for show- but for the amount of money, you would think two smaller sized women would at least feel a buzz after sharing a whole goblet. But nope- it was basically like drinking a gallon of Kool-Aid. I would go again with someone who has never gone before because it\\'s definitely cool to see the drink get poured over the dry ice but other than that... not too impressed.	0	0	0

I\\'ve been searching for a restaurant that served good vermicelli in Las Vegas for two years. I found it! The meat is well seasoned, the portions are fair and the prices are good especially considering that they\\'re located in a casino. This small noodle house serves not only Vietnamese but, Chinese and Thai as well. The decor is clever and eye-catching. I wouldn\\'t recommend this cute little place for large parties as it only seats about 50 people. I rated this restaurant at a three because the service is SUPER SLOW!

I must say that my initial reaction to their menu was shock... it is not quite \\"American\\" only, which is what makes Herringbone amazing.  As I researched for places to eat, I noticed that Herringbone was marketed as an American seafood restaurant, which to be honest does not sound exciting to me.  But the truth is that this place is a fusion restaurant with dishes from all over the world.  We had the Hamachi, beef tartare with truffle, chilaquiles, ceviche, moco loco, lobster roll, and a few other things that I can\\'t remember right now.  The Hamachi and ceviche were out of this world.  Chilaquiles was beautiful, but taste wise it was ok.  Lobster roll was great.  We inquired about mussels since I had seen those in Yelp but it wasn\\'t on the menu.  The waitress asked the chef if they could do mussels during lunch and he said yes.  However, we decided that we didn\\'t want mussels in the end... so to our surprise, the chef came out with a dish of mussels and said it was on the house since they had already started preparing it before we decided we didn\\'t want mussels.  Chef was super nice and the waitress was as well.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience and the food.  Definitely a place I would try over and over again.	0	0	0

I was recently here for dinner with my sister while on vacation and thought I\\'d stop by here due to the amazing reviews. The restaurant was pretty packed as we entered. As we were seated, I noticed that we were not handed a menu. So we sat and waited about 15 minutes before being given a menu. We were basically left to sit in the corner for about an additional 20 minutes. I was a little confused as to why things were taking so long. I mean the reviews on Yelp were really good. The customer service I found was extremely lacking, as our order was taken the waitress walked off and had not asked us if we wanted anything to drink. So I had to ask her myself. I told her that me & my sister wanted water and she returned 5 minutes later with bottle water (which a glass of free water would have been sufficient) The food took a while to come which did not surprise me at this point. The food was good not GREAT!!! The portion was large which is probably the only reason I gave them 2 stars. After we finished our meal, we could have basically walked out of the restaurant, I doubt they would have noticed anyways with the way things were going. I walked up to the counter and stood in front of the cashier to pay my bill. She took her sweet time and didn\\'t even realize I was there until one of her co-workers pointed it out to her. From here it took her about 5 minutes to hand me my bill and change. She did not even say thank you when she gave me my change. No tip was given obviously. I would not return to this restaurant due to the poor service.	0	0	0

Let\\'s say, this is where old people come to die because their service is soooo slow. I see nothing but old people eating here, and the place wasn\\'t even full. I ordered an entree salad and the server asked me if I wanted it to arrive with my friend\\'s entrees, I replied yes. 1 hour later, the food arrived. My salad came and it was freezer cold. My only guess is these idiots made my salad first, realized they made a mistake, so instead of tossing it, they placed my salad in the fridge/freezer to keep it cold. When I complained, one of the other waiters gave me a hard time (I couldn\\'t find my waitress). I had to be firm and told them to remake it. Anyway, the food was still disgusting, just like my friend\\'s food. Shut this place down, Monte Carlo. You can do better than this!	0	0	0

We were not looking to over eat, as we had a full evening planned. We started with the shell fish appetizer which had a variety of samplings which were wonderful. We ordered a steak/lobster tail per couple, to be shared, for dinner. We thought that with the two sides that we ordered - mushroom risotto and brussel sprouts - we would be just full enough. When the meal arrived the lobster wasn\\'t there. We asked the waiter and he advised that they were out of lobster AT 6 IN THE EVENING!  I asked he waiter why he didn\\'t mention this before the meal arrived, as we may have changed our order. He had no answer, but apologized.\\n\\nNow, to be fair, the steak was good. Not amazing as expected, but it was fine. The sides we delicious, but we never did really rebound from our disappointment over not having lobster at a restaurant known for its seafood. The worse part is that when we left there were several people eating lobster!!!!!\\n\\nThe waiter did bring us a delicious desert, and the meal was comped by the amazing Bellagio thanks to our gambling, so I really have no reason to complain. However, word to the wise, if you are going to spend $400.00 on dinner, you may have better options on the strip.	0	2	0

That may have worked for their ahi tuna tar tar appetizer and salad, but it definitely didn\\'t work to their favor when it came to their entrees. The meat came out cold, looking lumpy red, and the fish came out tough and dry, even when covered with white sauce. There was also a long delay in between the plates they brought out. They also had lobster pot pie but in all honestly, I only remembered it after going through my pictures. That says a lot about the dish.\\n\\nBright side though, each cold dish still ended up being quite tasty. Similarly to the one that we frequent in Glendale, the flavors are definitely spot on. \\n\\nDeserts ended up being the main attraction because everyone commemorated on the root beer float ice cream (really?), with a side of their soft cookie (... really?).\\n\\nNow question arises whether the overall experience at this place was worth the $250 per person (including drinks), and if you\\'re telling me that the only thing people liked from this place was the DESERT, then my obvious answer is no.\\n\\nAside from the initial 2-hour delay, our main server (not any of the girls or the guy in a suit) was the only one in the restaurant who was friendly to everyone during the entire time and was also quite attentive to our needs.\\n\\nIf we had to do it all over again, we would have booked Picasso instead.	11	7	6

At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \\n\\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \\n\\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \\n\\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn\\'t do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \\"Yes, please, another round\\" after flagging someone down.  \\n\\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N\\'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov\\'s dog.\\n\\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \\n\\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \\"fine.\\"\\n\\nManagement comped one of the two Tito\\'s I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I\\'d had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \\n\\nIn all fairness, the staff at D\\'s did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn\\'t until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \\"buyer\\'s remorse\\").\\n\\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \\"satisfy the customer.\\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \\n\\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \\"celebrity\\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It\\'s the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :\\'(  \\n\\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril\\'s establishments. I doubt I\\'ll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I\\'ve left the building and think I\\'ll stick to D\\'s in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me.

Very delicious.  Especially with the Oscar style asparagus a must.  Highly recommend it.	0	0	0

There is usually a line if you come during lunch and dinner times because the restaurant is small and is pretty well known. They offer pretty genuine Thai Food with superb service. Every time I have been here the waitresses have been amazing. I usually sit outside in the back patio. They have heaters and the patio is enclosed so do not worry about getting too cold.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n1.) Waterfall Beef (Appetizer)- This tender beef is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. The beef is perfectly cooked: tender, juicy and clean. My favorite part of the dish in the sauce it comes with. I do not know how they make the sauce but Im guessing its a mixture of vinegar, fish sauce and heaven! haha. I wanted to pour it on everything!\\n\\n2.) Thom Kha Kai (Soup)- This lemon grass coconut soup is a must try! I can\\'t quite find the words to explain the taste but if you like sweet, tangy with a bit of spice, it\\'ll be the perfect dish for you.\\n\\n3.) Padt Thai (Noodles)- These rice noodles with stir-fried egg, green onion, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, and cilantro left me craving for more!\\n\\n4.) Drinks- Thai Tea or Singha (signature Thai beer)\\n*The owner\\'s son is pretty cool too ;P*	2	1	3

Open patio on the 2nd level with an awesome view of the strip, though no smoking is allowed.  Food was good, lots of classics with minor twists.  Overall would love to come back, service was lacking.  Seemed a bit understaffed, our server had a lot to cover and I don\\'t blame her for not being able to get our drinks in a timely  manner.  Would go back...with the right people in the right situation, lol.	1	0	0

The menu is price fixe and for $45 you get a 6 course meal that includes amazing bread, beef, and banana chocolate pastry. I would seriously consider fasting all day before this epic meal as we really struggled to eat it all because it\\'s just so much food! Also definitely make a reservation as it\\'s a very intimate space. Expect to spend some money but leave full and with a fun experience.	3	1	1

Of course, we also visit periodically throughout the year but New Years Eve includes about 13 of us. Thank you to Hong Kong Garden for accommodating us!\\n\\nA complimentary house soup is served table side, and there\\'s always a scramble as several family members vie for a bowel with the coveted chicken feet. I\\'m impressed by how clean the bones are when they\\'re done!\\n\\nI\\'m addicted to their salt & pepper calamari - it\\'s seasoned and fried perfectly! We also always order clams - this year we ordered them two ways: one in a black bean sauce and one in a ginger sauce. Both were very good! The vermicelli noodles were also a hit, and my Dad ordered the orange peel beef, which was very tasty. We usually order the bok choy, but since they were out we tried the snow pea leaves with garlic and they were such a hit they quickly disappeared, as did the bar-b-que fried rice.\\n\\nThe Peking duck is delicious (thank you for accommodating all 13 of us with one order!), and the remaining duck was happily enjoyed after devouring the delightful duck served with scallions & cucumber wrapped in delicate white pancake.\\n\\nWe tried a new hot pot this year of pork and mushrooms. This particular hot pot had a more delicate flavor and lots of rice.\\n\\nWe finished our meal with a complimentary serving of black bean tapioca, and it was a perfect way to end a very enjoyable meal!\\n\\nHappy New Year!	1	0	1

I get the BBQ pork Banh Mi sandwich at least once a week. I\\'ve had Banh Mi from other places and let me tell you this one is the best.  The bread is toasty warm and they put more meat than any of the other places in Vegas.  And let me tell you ...The pickled veggies are deeeelish!!  I\\'ve done both take-out and eat-in.

If you can manage to make a decision from their huge menu (way too many options for me).

Think of it almost as a somewhat higher quality In n Out. They have a pretty extensive menu with chicken burgers and their regular burgers. Also, you can build your own burger. They also have a number of different sides and shakes.\\n\\nI like to get the Sin City burger, which has onions, egg, smash sauce, and bacon. Top it off with a side of smash fries and you\\'re set.\\n\\nThey are a little bit on the greasy and pricey side, but this place is a pretty solid burger joint.	0	0	1

I get the snails and black bean sauce it\\'s a little spicy, tastes, and smells great tho. Crab meat and fish maw soup is what I usually start out with. I\\'ve had hot pot here a bunch of times. There is a really big variety of veggies, meats, and broths to choose from. The poached chicken and ginger sauce along with a roster duck, are some of the things I eat here regularly.	2	0	0

A couple of my coworkers had been to a different location and were quite unimpressed, but this location exceeded all of our expectations. If you\\'ve heard bad things about the other location (which I can not corroborate) then it is still definitely worth your time to come to this location.\\n\\nThere were four of us, and we tried four different things. The beef and chicken curries is what I got, as well as pita chips and hummus. The curries are amazing, and the hummus is very good. It doesn\\'t take top spot for best I\\'ve had, but it\\'s definitely ranked very very highly. That was quite surprising for me, as this is basically Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I didn\\'t expect hummus this well executed from a place like that. \\n\\nI think that actually sums up anything else I could say: I had a certain level of expectation for this place and it blew that expectation out of the water. The food was great, worth well above what they\\'re charging. This is restaurant-quality food at fast-food prices. \\n\\nI will, without a doubt, be back here quite regularly. I can\\'t think of a better endorsement than to become a regular.	1	0	1

We thought we were going to have a great experience.  It started off ok.  Our bartender wasn\\'t the friendliest guy.  I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.\\n\\nIt keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn\\'t care.  She didn\\'t seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it\\'s not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don\\'t care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn\\'t care and couldn\\'t wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn\\'t care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can\\'t help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren\\'t that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn\\'t hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it\\'s a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell\\'s Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?  If  had known it was $50 for 2 scallops I never would have ordered it,  if you want to start your night off on the wrong foot and pay lots for nothing then you need to go to this place.	5	1	0

I\\'m hoping Carlito\\'s sticks around because they serve tasty Cuban food at a great value. They don\\'t accept credit cards, so bring cash.\\n\\nIt\\'s cafeteria-style and a great alternative to fast food when you\\'re short on time and looking to spend around $5 on lunch. The patio seating out front had a good crowd at lunch time. I didn\\'t see any written menu available, so I just selected from the prepared options on display. When it comes to Cuban food, I really only eat black beans, white rice, fried plantains, and guava pastries. They have the traditional espresso machine behind the counter, so I\\'ll be back for some sweet Cuban coffee.	5	1	2

I asked for a small to go plastic container when she handed it to me i did not realized that it\\'s too small for the food that I want to take home and so I asked if I can get the next bigger box she has, then she answered with an attitude \\"we\\'ll you said small!\\". So I just ignored her and again asked for a plastic bag to put in my to go food, she did not answer me and instead just pointed out where I can grab them plus she gave me an annoying look.

(i\\'m sure the fact that the people that were there were absolutely amazingly cool had something to do with it too)	0	0	0

It\\'s like a symphony of food rising until the end and then desert as the perfect finish.  However, having eaten at the Michael Mina in SF and having eaten here, I have to say the service at the SF location was far superior.  That\\'s not to say it wasn\\'t good here.  But it seemed like the staff at the SF location had just the right amount of attention - they noticed when we enjoyed a specific wine pairing more than others and made sure to offer a second glass.  Then the waiter, seeing that we were about ready to leave, actually went out and flagged a cab down for us and held it until we were all ready to walk out the door.  Similar service has happened in SF each of the 4 times I\\'ve been.\\nThis experience is what made me fall in love with the Michael Mina group of restaurants.\\n\\nHowever, it seemed like the staff at the location in Las Vegas, just weren\\'t up to that level.  We waited a good 10+ minutes before seeing someone.  Our table (even though we had a reservation, was not ready upon arrival at the right time, and I had to flag over the waiter a few times to get either more water or a bit more wine.\\n\\nIf the food was anything less than perfect I would have problem given 2-3 due to this service issue, but again, in my opinion, the food is the best I\\'ve ever had.	0	0	0

The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \\n\\nBBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \\n\\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it\\'s not on the lunch menu online and I can\\'t remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn\\'t come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \\n\\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a\\'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you\\'ll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \\n\\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It\\'s pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.	4	0	1

Yes, they do a lot of wooing and presentation.  The food, even though it looks appetizing, it\\'s not. \\n\\nWe raise quality Angus beef and know the difference.  They served a porterhouse, rather sizable (32 ounce), was disgusting.  Even then tenderloin was not tender.  The New York strip side was tough and not easy to cut even with a steak knife.\\n\\nThere were a total of six of us and there were at least six issues with the order.  \\n\\nTwo out of six at the table had positive things to say about the steak they were served, filet mignon,  and rib eye.	2	0	0

Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn\\'t the founder of the original Delmonico\\'s of New Orleans.\\n\\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico\\'s serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who\\'ve been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \\"Commander\\'s Palace\\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \\"Delmonico\\'s\\".    And that\\'s a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I\\'ve ever eaten was at the New Orleans\\' Delmonico\\'s... not the Vegas location.\\n\\nGOOD NEWS:  IT\\'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\\nBut I don\\'t think you\\'ll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it\\'s all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\\n\\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\\nHere\\'s the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\\n1) FLAVOR\\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico\\'s and I think Charlie Palmer\\'s outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina\\'s StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It\\'s probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \\n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \\n2) SERVICE\\nIf you\\'re looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it\\'s hard to beat Delmonico\\'s.  That\\'s something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer\\'s probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there\\'s rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I\\'ve consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\\n3) DÉCOR\\nIt\\'s darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I\\'ve noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I\\'m not sure this is really a big point.  \\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nDelmonico\\'s, while it\\'s lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\\n\\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\\n\\n-----------------\\nINSIDER\\'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO\\'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d\\' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You\\'ll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \\n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico\\'s in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I\\'ve pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d\\' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \\n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on \\'immediate seating\\' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu\\'s really has no such seating other than \\"next table available\\")	5	4	4

The steak was cooked to perfection.  I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.  I ended up having to get some finishing salt to give it a little more flavor.  \\n\\nI will go there again if I stay at the Palazzo, but I still have a preference to a couple other steaks houses.  service was great, food was great. just thought the steak could have been a little better seasoned.	0	0	1

I\\'ve been to Spain and spent hours in a tapas bar drinking wine eating great food and enjoying great conversation. \\nThis comes real close to the tastes. I came here with a small group with intentions to see what Chef Errol was all about. I was very impressed with the fact he was using Food Science which is the new cutting edge trends hitting up many spots in LA and NY.\\nThe ambiance of the place is very dark, clean, and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally nice.\\nWe let Chef decide what to make for us. \\nThe drinks were very good. Made from fresh ingredients. This place also has a guiness surger! SCORE!\\nThe food is exceptional and the price is definitely reasonable.\\nI enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. Very flavorful. The salad was warm and you can really taste the dressing and the individual flavors. The lamb was phenomenal. We enjoyed the Carpaccio, LOBSTER, and tortilla espaniola which is so authentic spanish.(It wasn\\'t room temperature which is how it\\'s supposed to be served) It was warm and tasty with the herbs and potatoes. Definitely try the duck breast. - I usually like it more rare, but it was definitely delish. The dessert presentation was very classy yet cutting edge. Truffles and Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL! If you get a chance you definitely should try this out.\\nI\\'m not really too sure why there were even bad reviews. HATERS!	8	3	4

Would have rather fewer options and better quality,  as MGM buffet seemed to have a quantity over quality problem.  \\n\\nThe service was awesome though, especially for a buffet! Margarita, our waitress, was super attentive and kept the mimosas flowing and didn\\'t judge us for drinking them too quickly.\\n\\nIn short, I had a decent omelet, and some fruit and veggies, that left me full for hours! I also left with a good buzz from those delicious mimosas so I could hit the strip with confidence!\\n\\nI should note, I had a free voucher so I wasn\\'t expecting much. Would I return and pay full price? Probably not, but sign up and play MyVegas and you can redeem points and go for free... because who doesn\\'t love free champagne?!  \\n\\nOh, and in case you\\'re wondering, my favorite buffet is at the Bellagio.	1	0	0

The only reason we went was because my 13 and 15 yr old wanted to check it out.  There signature drinks did not have a price on the menu so we asked the waitress how much for the non-alcoholic Drake drink, she said $34, my kids decided it pretty steep and opted to pass on it, but my husband and I insisted they try it.  When the drink arrived they took a couple of sips and said it was not worth the price which made me and my husband proud, it was a great lesson in life, $34 may of been too steep for this novelty drink/restaurant but the experience was priceless. Just another overpriced and over endorsed place on the Strip.	0	0	0

The food here is serious stuff.  I had the chance to try three different dishes here and none disappointed. \\n\\nThe sweet/savory interplay that is the Awesome Noodles (and they live up to the name) or the lip-smacking goodness of the Braised Short Rib Fried Rice (even the long name won\\'t derail your enjoyment of this dish-my favorite-) Its all good in this joint that is frequented by both tourists and locals. \\n\\nAlso of special mention is the Pork Jerky appetizer. A plate of fried pork goodness served with a sauce that is everything thai food should be. Mix both in the side of white rice and you might be tempted to forgo an entrée and have two servings of this dish. \\n\\nWhether you\\'re a local looking for a place to add to you favorites list or a tourist looking for a true taste of Las Vegas, Le Thai should not be missed.  Highly recommended.	0	0	0

At our arived, we didn\\'t feel welcome from the waiter. They dropped manus and left. The restaurant didn\\'t busy but we have to ask him to fill our empty glass. The foods were of salty. Nigiri were huge but not fresh; not sweet and not smooth. Uni was bitter. We paid about 80 dollars but I feel like I was eating at AYCE place, compare to the fish.	0	0	0

So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality.  I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all.\\n\\nOur server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.	1	0	0

So although I love to get out and explore the LV foodie scene, I have neglected the diner-type establishments.  So after attending the Elton John Million-Dollar Piano show, my family was looking for some comfort food.  Wow!, Did we ever find the place!  It was not that crowded at 11 PM (Open 24) on January 1st.  When I picked up the menu, I didn\\'t expect it to be as thick as Melville\\'s Moby Dick, but it was!  This may be the most extensive menu that I have ever seen.  I talked my wife out of the spaghetti, b/c it just didn\\'t seem like an Italian place...but trust me, they even have a page or two of Italian specialties.  My son had a Chicken and Apple Compote Waffle dish, while I had the Meatloaf with sausage gravy with bacon on a biscuit....CULINARY GENIUS.  We did not have room for desert, but the pies and baked goods looked amazing.\\n\\nThis could be the best diner in LV, I know that I am not looking any further!	2	0	0

This is located across the street from Insert Coins in Downtown Vegas. They have happy hour from 3-6pm Monday-Friday and Saturday from 11am-4pm which includes pork jerky, wings, chicken satay, waterfall beef and of course, alcohol. They have Stella, Chang, San Miguel beer, vodka, rum, tequila, gin, wine, Spiked Thai Iced Tea and a drink interestingly called Ladyboy Cocktail. Since getting hammered while wearing a dress before Les Miserables might not be such a great idea, I didn\\'t partake in happy hour which means I\\'d have to come back. I had non-spiked Thai Iced Tea instead.\\n\\nWe got Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp spicy 3/5, Garlic Fried Rice with chicken spicy 3/5, Spicy Eggplant with tofu and Short Rib Fried Rice. We finished our meal with an order of Roti.\\n\\nPad Thai:\\nWhat I noticed was that it doesn\\'t come with crushed peanuts but it still tastes good. Great flavor. Spicy, lightly salty and sweet - the classic Thai flavor combination. 4/5\\n\\nGarlic Fried Rice:\\nI should have ordered this dish at spicy 2/5 instead. I missed out on the garlic taste and my nose was running. My bad. It\\'s a delicious dish though and I\\'m sure I would have tasted flavor elevations had my tastebuds not been burned. 4/5\\n\\nSpicy Eggplant:\\nIn an attempt to eat something healthy with all the meat and carb dishes we got, we decided to get a veggie dish and add tofu instead of meat. Tasty dish with bell peppers, onion in Thai chili sauce. 3.5/5\\n\\nShort Rib Fried Rice:\\nThe best dish we tried. Tender, juicy shreds of mildly sweet short rib...sooo good. I couldn\\'t stop eating this. 5/5\\n\\nRoti:\\nNutella spread on roti topped with egg drizzled with condensed milk and dusted with powdered sugar. It\\'s sweet but not overly sweet. I love Nutella so I was bound to like this dessert. The fried egg on top cuts the sweetness of the dish. 4/5\\n\\nGreat service. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They get real busy by around 6pm. The prices weren\\'t bad.	4	1	1

The worst part is that we had to send one of the meals back.  The cheese sauce on the mac-burger tasted bad.  This is something that the person who ordered it has apparently had many times at other CF\\'s, and he said that the sauce on this wrong tasted bad, as in spoiled.  The server was nice and took it off our check.	0	0	0

I was quietly greeted and quickly seated and handed the menu. The waiter returned shortly later with a pticher of water (woohoo!!) and asked if I was ready to order.\\n\\nI decided on the tonkotsu ramen with an extra side of noodles (+2) and extra nor (+1.50). There were some unconventional choices such as lobster miso, spicy miso, and buta-san. These choices were not completely unexpected considering Bachi Burger had some very inventive burger/sandwich combinations.\\n\\nThe ramen came out quickly. There were several slices of fatty pork, wood ear fungus, a sheet of nori, chopped green onion, julienned green onions (the extra negi I had ordered), and some black sesame oil (?). The pork was soft and tender, but there was a mild charred after taste to it. It wasn\\'t terrible, just unexpected. The broth was good: not too salty, rich, but not very flavorful. In short, the broth just really didn\\'t make a huge impression on me. The noodles were just a touch harder than I prefer. I was checked on frequently and my table cleared quickly\\n\\nMy total bill for the bowl of tonkotsu ramen, extra noodles, extra negi with tax and tip was $15, a little pricey. Overall, Shoku is a good addition to the Vegas ramen scene, service was friendly and quick. The distance/location of the shop along with the somewhat poor value makes me think twice about making a trip just to try the other types of ramen.	3	0	1

We\\'d pass by this place many times on our way to the gym, so I was excited to try it! When we first walked in, I noticed how clean the place was. The bathroom was nice and the toilet paper was thick and soft, which is surprising for a fast food type place. Furthermore, the service was good except the guy who was handling our order was in a rush and made our order wrong... But it\\'s okay. The dinner rush can be rough when there\\'s a lot of people coming by for dinner! \\n\\nFOOD: Imagine a Chipotle style food bar where you tell the associate what you\\'d like. I had the falafal bowl and my husband has the steak bowl. The food was okay. The falafal was cripsy. I added the hummus in my bowl, which was tasty. BEWARE - the green mild sauce is pretty spicy! The red hot sauce just taste hot and lacks flavor. The steak lacked taste. I believe there are better Mediterranean places around town to try with better food and service. \\nIf you check-in, you get a free dessert. They baklava was small. We got the almond one, which was okay. \\n\\nPRICE: For our two bowls and the free dessert it was around $20, which is fair. The portions was pretty big and I had to take half of it home so it was great value. \\n\\nOverall, I give it a 3-star since everything was okay. I probably would not come back though. \\n\\nHappy Dining, \\n\\nJT	0	0	0

The service though can be a little iffy.   So tonight we go to use a groupon that was a gift.   Our \\"server\\" Jennilee informs us - in the most condescending tone I have EVER heard that we were 7 minutes too late to use the coupon.  Well we had been sitting at the table and she had ignored us while flirting with some guy at the bar.    She then informs us that she saw us walk in and it didn\\'t matter we were too late and the \\"system\\" wouldn\\'t allow the sale.   Well our money spends just as well in a different establishment.  I was ready to leave.   My partner likes the beer selection and after working all day it was time to eat.   Jennilee then disappears after taking our order.  Never asks if we need anything, if we needed more drinks, are we still breathing.   Now the place was not busy.   There was 1 other table, 3 guys at the bar and a few people playing pool.  Jennilee stood at the bar flipping her hair and flirting with a guy.    Total disappointment.   Utter lack of customer service.   The personality of a dead bird.   It\\'ll be a long looonnnggg time before I consider going back.	0	0	0

I loved the food at Bachi, but stopped going there because the wait was ridiculous, the service was really bad, and they were pretentious.  \\n\\nMerging the spaces and redecorating did not speed up the wait time, but we were able to get some counter space way quicker than waiting for a table.  The service was still crappy.  We got flat $3 Diet Cokes and the waitress did not seem to think flat soda was an issue.  And even though we did not drink them, we still had to pay for them.\\n\\nI ordered the 5 spice Shoyu Ramen for $10.  This sounded interesting to me because I have never heard of ramen with chicken.  I assume it\\'s not traditional, since I have never seen it at any noodle house, but it was very good.  It was a shoyu broth with free-range chicken breast, wavy noodles, bok choy, green onion, mushroom, and fish cakes.  The broth was not too salty, but it needed a little kick so I added chili strands and chili spice.  The chicken had skin, but was very good once I removed it.  \\n\\nAll in all, if I had to go back to Shoku, I would likely order a burger from the Bachi menu, but I would order this again if I was in a soup mood; even though it is overpriced for ramen.	2	1	1

Been wanting to try this place for years, so when the groupon came up & thought it would be perfect to try it out. Upon entering, we were seated in an old room that may have been cool back in the 90\\'s but not so much anymore. The first course was shrimp scampi, not bad but not impressive. Second course was the bowl of soup that tasted like progresso, then the hummus platter that was ok. Then the steak skewers that weren\\'t bad but again not anything great. Lastly the chicken & cous cous. This isn\\'t Moroccan food. \\n\\nThe other strange thing was the belly dancer was Asian, aren\\'t we at a Moroccan restaurant? Don\\'t get me wrong, she was good. \\n\\nFor 4 people to dine, with the $65 off for the groupon it still was $102. I\\'m sorry but it definitely was not worth it. Way better Mediterranean food at Paymons. Lastly the service was lacking, I sat for 20 minutes with an empty water glass, and the place was not busy. Save your $ go somewhere else.\\n\\nFake Moroccan restaurant. Owners are Lebanese.	0	1	0

I enjoyed how it was located in downtown Las Vegas so there was a lot to do after eating including going to a bar or just looking at street art. The bartender greeted us right when we entered and we were given the option to sit anywhere we liked. We went around 4pm so happy hour was going on. The dishes we ordered were waterfall beef, spicy eggplant with shrimp, and chicken pad Thai. The presentation of each dish was incredible and the tastes were even better. The waterfall beef was served with sticky rice which I\\'m not a fan of, but I ended up enjoying it. I had a taste of the pad Thai,it had all the flavors a pad Thai should have. With the spicy eggplant I enjoyed how they didn\\'t use jumbo shrimps and the eggplant was cooked perfectly. Our server was very friendly and checked up on us a couple times. I honestly can\\'t wait to go back to try other dishes from the menu.	1	0	0

The staff here were really friendly and accommodating. Although this place is really small and you can practically be apart of the conversation of the people at the table next you I still did enjoy my meal. I ordered a Thai Ice Tea which I didn\\'t see on the menu but was happy that they had it. It was good but not great. Could have been a little sweeter. As for the food we ordered the pork jerky whit sticky rice. The sauce this dish came with was incredibly delicious. Tangy, Spicy, and lots of cilantro. We also order the garlic beef fried rice which was also delicious and full of flavor. Everything on the table was level 3 from 0-5 on their spice meter and in my opinion was just the perfect amount to make me have to take a few sips of water and want to come back for more until it was all done. Next time I\\'m on this side of town I will definitely be coming back here.	0	0	1

In fact, I would eat at McDonalds or Burger King over the steak sandwiches at this location anytime.  My cheese steak consisted of a stingy sprinkle of cheese on a soggy bun with very well done chewy steak.  They obviously don\\'t make each sandwich to order and cook the meat well ahead of time.  I hope corporate does something to improve the quality at this location, the food sold here is a poor representation of what the Great Steak chain has to offer.	0	0	0

To break it down, I\\'ll explain why I gave this buffet 2 stars.\\nThe first star was for the selection and variety of food, from Sea Food to Mexican food to yummy deserts. The second star was for the service. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Here is why I don\\'t particularly care for this buffet: This place was WAY overpriced. $30 per person for dinner. That price would be acceptable had the food been fresh, warm, tasty, and cooked well. The coffee was awful. It tasted like mildew. \\nThe Only good food item I ate was the caramel cheesecake. The Cesar salad was tasteless and nearly dry. The lasagna was dry as well. It tasted like a freezer burn lasagna that you pull out to eat for dinner as a last resort. \\nThe mashed potatoes were good, but how hard is it to make good mashed potatoes?? The shrimp was pretty fresh and clean as well. One of the biggest upsets was the fried chicken; just gross. \\nAll in all, I would Not recommend eating here and we won\\'t be returning. Bummer!	0	1	0

The steaks had absolutely NO flavor, the options weren\\'t good and the ahi salad with a whopping 3 small pieces of tuna was far from worth the cost. I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don\\'t bother with this one....	1	0	0

It was 5:00 and people were coming in for dinner and they did not have enough people working to sit people.  There were open tables and people were getting mad.  My husband is a sushi man and he said that is was very very dry.  He even tried it when they had bought more out and still said it was dry.  The watermelon was not sweet it was tasteless.  I don\\'t think they had a good variety of food or deserts. However, I did like the small portions of the way they did the deserts.  They were small portions so not wasteful if you did not eat it all. They just did not have a variety to pick from.  They did not have any kind of pies or cakes.\\n\\nI did however, think the way they cut the crab open was great. It looks like they slice it open.  You would think that the MGM and the Rio would be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas but this time that we were here we were disappointed in both of them.  Our favorite was the flamingo.  They have the BEST buffet in Las Vegas and we give them a 5 star for their bufett. \\n\\nWould we go there again . Mosty likely NOT to pricey and not the best.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s\\nNorthern California	1	0	0

I believe this location has 1 Michelin star and I was excited to give it a try. Our party came for the $60 3course Prix Fixe menu. We arrived a little late and they only offer the menu within a short hour between 5-6pm i believe. However the waiter was nice enough to offer the menu anyway. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nice and clean in the restaurant. I had my doubts walking into this place because it was located next to the arboretum at the Bellagio and it was particularly busy that evening.  But the sound from the crowd was nicely muted within the restaurant, I hardly notice all the passerby outside as soon as we sat down. \\n\\nthe menu was great. My brother opted in for the tuna tartare. The waiter mixes the ingredients right infront of you and the dish was fresh and the flavors were vibrant. I opted for their pumpkin soup and grill cheese sandwich. I don\\'t remember what the cheese was but that sandwich was delicious... It was down right magical. The soup was creamy and the flavors were strong. Some might not like it as much if they don\\'t like pumpkin but it sat well with me.\\n\\nSecond course I opted for their lobster pot pie. It was $20 extra I believe but it was totally worth it. They stuck a whole lobster in the pot and baked in its own juices and veggies. The lobster has got to be a good 3lb. I was stuffed from this. The other people in my party got the filet. I can\\'t comment on that dish because I didn\\'t try it. But it did look delicious and my friend said it melted in his mouth. So I\\'m going to assume its good.\\n\\nThe dessert was either the rootbeer float or the chocolate truffle. Both were good. The float had a little waffer straw which was a nice touch. The chocolate was intense but with a very nice texture. \\n\\nthe service was good all around. I am wonderfully surprised with this restaurant. I would not mind returning and trying the Chef\\'s menu next time.	0	0	0

Essentially, the \\"Concession and Franchise Fee\\" is like a resort fee, but you get nothing in return. This fee has \\"deceptive business practice\\" written all over it. The fee is listed on the menu in tiny print that is hard to see and read. The solution to the growing problem of CNF charge in Vegas is easy: Don\\'t go to these places. Run, don\\'t walk, to establishments that appreciate you and your patronage. I understand that it can be expensive to operate a business, but the food and drinks are already over priced. There is no need for this fee.	0	3	0

We particularly love the Drunken Noodles and the crab Rangoon.  The reason I gave Le Thai a 4 star vs 5 star is due to the service I received there today.  I am not an unreasonable or unpleasant customer as I have waited tables in my college years and know it\\'s not an easy job however:\\n1.  Our waiter took his break in the middle of our visit and failed to properly hand us off to another waiter. \\n2. During the break we ordered soup (which is typically large enough for 4 adults - we ordered 2 of these) and when the soup was brought to our table, no additional bowls for serving everyone, none were provided.  We had to ask twice to get enough for everyone.\\n3.  When spooning out the soup into a bowl, some of it spilled on my hand and I received a 2nd degree burn.  Despite informing my waiter (once he returned from his break) and receiving ice to help with the pain, no apologies were offered and I would have thought at least the manager would stop by the table - nope.  \\n\\nBottom line:\\n\\nFood is amazing - get take out or delivery.  :)	0	0	0

There are as many different versions and variants as there are pit masters and pigs. Some folks like it spicy while others prefer it sweet.  Some like it soaked in sauce and others like it dry.  Some like it heavily smoked while other folks prefer just hints of wood. There really is no single requirement or standard.  This is why running a BBQ joint can be a tough gig. You know you\\'re just not going to be able to make it great - for everybody.  At its core however, BBQ is ultimately a choreography of wood, fire, and meat that, when properly executed, is a thing of beauty.  To do this at home is one thing, but to do it in a restaurant-based production line is something completely different. It is a business and an art many fail at. \\n\\nI had heard so much about RS over the years I was very excited to find their new facility in Summerlin.  As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the Strip unless all other dining options (including the neighbor\\'s cat) have been exhausted.  Okay...that was a joke...I love cats... and I would have to catch it.  Anyway, when the new RS opened near me, I made it a point to drop by.  With almost 2000 four and five star reviews, I went with very high  expectations - maybe too high. \\n\\nI ordered two of their five meat plates to go. Each plate came with three small sides, so I upgraded them to larges and figured I would have ample food to feed six. The service was courteous and fast, so when I headed out the door with two heavy bags in tow I was giddy about the impending feast.  That story changed somewhat when I got home and uncrated the grub. \\n\\nThe first thing that struck us was the size (or lack thereof) of the side portions.  We opened up the large side containers to find them only 3/4 (or less) full.  When we opened up the cornbread boxes (I purchased 3 orders) we were also disappointed to find 6 tiny (I mean tiny) squares. I remember my wife joking that they had clearly mixed up their cornbread with their croutons.  By the time the sides were distributed we each had about a tablespoon or two of each one. \\n\\nRANT FOLLOWS: C\\'mon guys - you\\'re not on The Strip feeding a bunch of hungover tourists who will never return.  You are in Summerlin  feeding your hard working fellow locals - and we want a manly piece of cornbread and grown up side servings!  I paid over 80 bucks for my order and, for that price, I should be granted a full container of beans!! We are your desert brothers and sisters...we come to you because we are hungry...feed us! Okay, I feel better... sorry. \\n\\nUnlike the sides, the meat portions were ample. The chicken was outstanding.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked, and fall off the bone tender. Great bird guys!  The hot links were tasty as well, as were the ribs.  I wouldn\\'t change a thing on either. \\n\\nThe brisket and pork, however, were disappointing to say the least. The brisket we received was so chewy it required a sharp knife (a brisket no no), and the pork was something else entirely.  I have had pulled pork, chopped pork, chunked pork, pork loin, pork butt, and pork chops but what we received was a pile of what can best be described as \\"pork hash.\\"  It was almost minced.  When I tasted it, it became clear why they had done this. It was full of fat.  That also explained the oozing pool of grease it floated on.  It had a great flavor though - I can\\'t wait to go back and try the actual meat. \\n\\nFinally, on a positive note, the sauces were a home run.  Our favorites were the mustard and vinegar selections. Just like back home, and even a bit better.  You could pour this stuff on a rock and make it edible.  Great sauces guys! Best I have had in town - by far. \\n\\nBottom line here is that RS makes some tasty stuff; tasty enough to bring us back for a second try in a month or two.  In the meantime, my hope is that they get their heads off \\"The Strip\\" and start feeding their fellow desert brethren like we deserve.  I will even give them a pass on the brisket and greasy fatty pork, because their sauce is so good it even made them edible.  And the collard greens....did I mention the collard greens? Pure Southern  perfection.	3	0	0

There are new businesses opening up and some like Le Thai are thriving.  The atmosphere here is laid back cool and the people here are welcoming.  \\n\\nThis place also has the second best Phad Thai I\\'ve ever had.  To be honest with you,  I had a bowl of it early Thursday afternoon and I almost went back to get more for dinner but I resisted...until lunch the next day.  I seriously couldn\\'t get it off my mind.\\n\\nThe food here is great.  $13 will get you a plenty big portion that has that unique mix of flavors I want in Phad Thai.  I ordered the spice level 4 but Ashley the bartender recommended 2 (\\"mild\\") out of 5 with some extra chilies on the side.  Long story short, the next day I easily handled the level 4 (\\"spicy\\") and the next time I\\'m going all the way to 5 (\\"Thai spicy\\"),\\n\\nI know most people going to downtown Las Vegas usually stay under the protective canopy of The Fremont Street Experience, which is a blast.  But for those adventurous souls that like to step out of the box and explore - you owe it to yourself to stop here and get yourself a bowl of Phad Thai.\\n\\nTip:  This place is BUSY so be prepared to be on a wait at lunch and dinner times.	8	3	6

As a guest at the Bellagio, I was rather excited to taste the so recommended menu. I was delighted with the staff and the service but absolutely disappointed with thr quality of the food. I must say that the dinner at Michael Mina\\'s restaurant could be considered as the most discouraging experience I have had. As I am vegan, my choices were limited but the waiter was helpful enough to recommend the tofu and the soup. As I have previously lived in the region of the truffle in Italy I am highly sensitive to its unique flavour. However, there was no sign of the truffle\\'s distinct fragnance in my butternutsquash soup which in addition was oversalted. Moreover, the following dish, the tofu with mushrooms and risotto was extremely greasy and salted to which my sensitive stomach did not react well. \\nAs I only eat out I have certainly tried plenty of different restaurants and must say that Michael Mina\\'s one is without a doubt the most disappointing one. I would most defintely advise against it.	1	0	0

They had hot crab legs, fried shrimp and Steaks.  The steaks were about 6-8 oz cuts and tasted very good.  I couldn\\'t wait to go back but, I was there over Thanksgiving weekend 3 days ago, and got FROZEN crab legs YUCK !!  No STEAK ,  Hand breaded shrimp that was decent, but the breading was falling off and very doughy.  This is Vegas and they obviously are trying to cut costs, how hard is it to boil Crab legs.  The Prime Rib was terrible, a rubber SHOE at best !  The server gave me a piece with blood all over it, should not of been served in the first place and the Server cutting the beef new it as she was starring at me when I walked down to my demise, I went back 5 minutes later to get another piece in hopes of a better cut and it was freaking terrible, looked like rubber and was very dull, no taste.  Out of the group of 7 we were all disappointed, ALL !!  The fruit selection was nothing great, salads average and the dessert was ok if you like Lemon Cheesecake, nothing to scream about.  The wait staff though was good at getting plates and drinks which is why it got 2 stars.  The Lobster Ravioli was so processed and phony, looked good tasted blah,  There was not 1 item I liked or really enjoyed.	0	0	0

He is super friendly and helpful and he made the best margaritas for my husband\\'s birthday and they have a beer on tap called El Jeffe and it is a beer with chile flavor steeped in. Really different and good.  The chef does specials for Monday night football and we were there for Chicago vs Minnesota so we each had one of the specials. Chicago was a loose take on the Chicago dog- bacon wrapped hot dogs with pico de gallo and cotija cheese, it was really good and a new hot dog flavor for me. The Minnesota special was a juicy lucy and it was amazing. For great food and service come to Herringbone for sure!	0	0	0

I think the price was $22, but since it was Saturday, for $2.50 more you could get unlimited champagne (cheap champagne, yes, but add some of the unlimited orange juice and it made a quite passable mimosa).\\n\\nThe food selection was unreal.  We tried everything - ham, prime rib, incredible ravioli, made-to-order eggs, great sausage gravy, some unnameable weird salad...the selection was endless and much better than any of the other buffets around the MGM, especially Mandalay Bay .  Favorites were the pastas, fresh guacamole, carrot cake, fruit selection...  Sometimes we had to wait for refills, but we were there for at least two hours and never got told to hurry up or denied anything.	0	0	0

This is because people come to Vegas to GET CRAZY! So after turning 21, I never really even put the effort into a night out on the strip because I imagined drunk girls, over crowded clubs, and \\'The Hangover\\' style hijinx.\\n\\nWhilst in-town for a Vegas wedding, my friends and I headed over to Beer Park, which my sister had found on Yelp. What a pleasant surprise! The bar was not too crowded and the atmosphere rocked! We had a full view of the strip and the DJ (Bayami) was playing the best set. We had such a fun time with our beer flights and playing oversized jenga that, get this, we came back the next day! Beer Park is all out fun atmosphere food and drinks! Stop here on your next Vegas trip for some fun that has nothing to do with the club scene!\\ninstagram: @glowrae	4	1	4

Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \\"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \\"let somebody know\\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.	0	0	0

Joshua was the best server I\\'ve had anywhere in a long time! Polite and friendly. \\n\\nWe both got combos (Black garlic / creamy Tonkotsu) with the 1st side option (stuffed dumplings). Amazing. So good....we will definitely be back. There was a little wait between the salad / appetizer / soup but it was because the kitchen was a little busy and it was worth the wait!! It wasn\\'t terrible and the servers tried hard to keep things moving. Cool modern feel...just go! :)	0	0	0

We were staying at Vdara, so we needed some food options! Very clean, great menu choices. Our server was great. Fast/Nice - but down to business. I like them like that, not too friendly.\\n\\nI was torn between a lot of menu choices - but went with the Chicken Fried Steak + Scrambled Eggs + Toast + Hashbrowns! All for a price of 12.99. The steak & gravy was AMAZZZZINGGGGGG. I was very impressed. Husband ordered the Ham/Sausage/Cheddar omelette and it was good. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed our meal here because we enjoy our time in the Monte.

I\\'m pretty sure that quote was referring to spicy food but I digress.\\n\\nI personally enjoy any opportunity to find my way downtown and more importantly to try new eateries.  Le Thai has been on my list for a while.\\n\\nEnthusiastic and hungry we approached the hostess stand only to be told there was a 60-minute wait *insert pouty face here*. No problem, we killed time next door until our seats were ready.\\n\\nI must have looked unusually disappointed or totally starving because not even 15 minutes later we were being paged that our seats were ready! SCORE!\\n\\nAmbiance can be best described as a hole-in-the-wall reminiscent of most restaurants in NYC (or Chicago).  It\\'s cool without being smug about it.  \\n\\nMost importantly the food: excellent portion sizes, bold flavors, spice level was right on point. Their spice chart is 1-4 and we went with 2\\'s all across the board. My friend was sweating, my nose was running but man oh man was it worth it. \\n\\nI can recall Le Thai not taking reservations in the past, but since they do currently, I highly recommend taking that extra step in securing your seating. The hostess took pity on us THIS time, but to ensure you are seated in a reasonable fashion, make a res.\\n\\nLe Thai is something that should be on your list of \\"to try\\".	3	0	2

Rani, the owner is as Indian as one can get and she\\'s a delightful character,  just don\\'t expect American customer service from her or her staff. Groceries are plenty and diverse, and her food is authentic and delish. The free chai is hard to beat, I love it, it reminds of the scene back home :-)	1	0	1

I finally got around to trying them for lunch on Valentine\\'s Day with the lovely Jaime W. as my dining date. \\n\\nWe started out with delicious hibiscus lemonades. Very refreshing, definitely something I would try again. We also shared a chicken satay appetizer. It was good, but not great.\\n\\nFor my meal, I went with the Mixed Vegetable lunch special which is a good deal at $6.95. The menu does not give a description of the dish, I assumed I would get an assortment of veggies like corn, mushrooms and broccoli. Instead I got onions and peppers in assorted colors. I was rather disappointed by this. \\n\\nI decided to go back and get some takeout before posting a review. This time I went with the Orange Chicken lunch special. I did not call in my order, but they still had me on my way in about 15 minutes. I liked this dish better then the Mixed Vegetable dish, but it still didn\\'t blow me away and I doubt I\\'d order it again. \\n\\nService each time was efficient and friendly, and since I work really close I will probably go back at some point to try the Pad Thai. Hopefully after that I can update and add another star but until then, Sin City Thai is just alright to me, nothing special.	3	0	2

Dinner is so-so,soup has too much salt, and my ankles and hands puff up the next day. The French toast is the bomb....only order the 4 slices. ..portion is very large,and best I\\'ve ever eaten world wide. They serve more pancakes than french toast. The selection of eggs Benedict is large,at least 4 different selections. Irish eggs Benedict is corned beef hash ...one of my favorites, German eggs Benedict is potato pancakes on English muffin and topped with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. 5 stars*****. Cakes and pie and made all day and night long. Always fresh.  Death by dessert  without a doubt. Service is super except Saturday and Sunday mornings between 11-2. Seems like all the church goers head right there. Very similar to New York diners. Been to all 3 locations, this one is a little better.	1	0	0

I really loved the ribeye, tuna salmon tartare, and their complimentary bread. The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \\n\\nI tried other dishes my friends got and they weren\\'t as good. My friends didn\\'t really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn\\'t really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too. \\n\\nIf you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It\\'s a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.	3	2	2

I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait. \\n\\nThe service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd\\'s pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn\\'t seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband\\'s dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish. \\n\\nFor both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria\\'s Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops. Newly expanded stores include: Swatch, Tommy Bahama, Harry Winston, and Anthropologie. It might be confusing to some people how the different levels are, but just ask someone to point you in the right direction.	2	1	0

My Family tried their \\"boodle Boat\\" for $64.99 (similar to a platter in other resto), In my opinion its pretty steep. I guess its because its on a boat. I was under the impression that I can take the boat home=). If you\\'re ordering the Boodle Boat prepare to wait.  Overall Rating: Good.	0	0	0

I use to come here all the time when I was in Vegas for their champaign brunch on Saturday or Sunday, but over the last two years this place has gone downhill. The last couple of times I\\'ve been there the food has been bland, dry, & often cold. The deserts are hard, & don\\'t really taste that good. Even the ice cream & jell-o is hard..... Not sure how they managed to pull that off, I guess they want to be consistent at having gross food all the way across the board.\\n\\nIt\\'s looks like they have a wide selection of food here but after walking through you realize it\\'s the same lame food on both sides. The only thing decent about this place is their servers are usually good with following up on you, but all they do is refill the soda like any other server at a buffet is suppose to do so who really gives a sh1t about that. If I\\'m dropping 17-26 bucks on a buffet I want good food not fresh tap water.\\n\\nSo in a nutshell F this place, you\\'re better off taking your money a half mile over to the food court and pay 6 bucks for a quarter pounder \\"without\\" cheese ($7.50 with) at the mcdonalds and use the remaining 12 bucks getting wasted on the free drinks at the penny slots.	1	0	0

I came here specifically expecting craft beers and a lot of them, but the selection was smaller than my dreams and the ads set me up for. \\n\\nI love craft beer and I want to feel like I\\'m getting something special at a decent craft beer price and atmosphere. It\\'s a tad steep here. Totally a tourist trap as others suggested. Viva Las Vegas! That being said, the atmosphere is great and delivers. Wonderful view and arrangement and lots of tvs. \\n\\nOh, the beer isn\\'t bad. Mmmm. Very good actually. I found quite a few beers I thoroughly enjoyed and could probably find more, but maybe not at these prices. I felt bad for all the guys getting Budlights. But that was kind of confusing and entertaining anyway. \\n\\nI\\'ve come back because it\\'s a great place to take visiting and novice family and friends or a big and generous group to watch the game in style. Beers on tap, chile verde nachos and brats are totally our language and the other half of why I\\'d return. Great beer and food. \\n\\nSo I suggest to come here when in the mood to be touristy and splurge, because all women foodies get this urge, don\\'t we?	2	1	0

My husband came here a few years ago and said it was his favourite!  \\n\\nI used OpenTable to make my reservation.  So convenient!  \\n\\nMost of our table had the signature tasting menu and two guests had the seasonal tasting menu.  If I had the option, I would\\'ve done some mixing and matching to get the best of both worlds.  \\n\\nThe first course of caviar was excellent.  I wished that was bigger.  I could easily have eaten a whole plate.  \\n\\nThe tuna tartare was a tad heavy on the sesame oil, but otherwise, the tuna itself was perfect.  I shared with my friend and got to try her hamachi.  That was incredible. \\n\\nMy miso glazed sea bass was amazing.  The texture was spot on.  The portion was just right and the flavours were well balanced.  \\n\\nWhat do you think of lobster pot pie?  Sounds like a good one, right?  The lobster was way overcooked.  It was actually a huge disappointment.  None of us wanted to say anything because we didn\\'t want another portion and we were getting full anyways, but this one was off the mark.  The carrots were undercooked.  Very strange dish.  \\n\\nThe wagyu steak was good.  Not fantastic, not terrible, just good.  The truffle was a nice addition but I felt the foie gras was unnecessary.  Of course, that might\\'ve been because we had just consumed the whole roasted foie gras served table side.  That was really good.  I preferred the middle pieces whereas some of our table enjoyed the end pieces.  Chacun son gout!  \\n\\nI liked the mini root beer float, but I\\'m a sucker for root beer.  The cookies were nice and moist.  The chocolate bar was very rich after such a filling meal, I wish I ate it all but just didn\\'t have room.  I tried my friend\\'s panna cotta and that was light and delicate.  Very smooth on the palate.  Passion fruit and avocado, go figure!  \\n\\nOverall, considering quality, quantity, and value, this was a good meal.  \\n\\nThe lobster threw me off (it threw us all off).	1	3	2

First of all, they won\\'t take your mlife card unless you use it for slots.  The cashier didn\\'t tell me that, when I went to the Bellagio buffet (big sister property) explained to me where you have to ask for a voucher.  I should have went to McDonalds at the food court instead.\\n\\nFor the food, it so not worth the price.  The only thing that is good is the prime rib and ny steak, otherwise, it\\'s a one star.  The crab legs were too salty, smoked salmon was not really smoked, shrimp (for cocktail) was puny.  Don\\'t need to say anymore.	5	1	2

I have never seen/had a lobster so easy to eat. The way they prepared it made it so easy to pull the meat from the shell. It was almost effortless. Highly recommend this.\\n\\nWe also had the crab cake poppers ($19) and the clam chowder ($14). Both were just ok. If crab cake is what you are looking for, go to Brian Malarkey\\'s other restaurant Searsucker in Caesars. I had the best crab cake there.\\n\\nThe grilled chicken sandwich ($18) was underwhelming. Ora king salmon ($34) was cooked perfectly but the sweet sauce that it comes with ruined it for me. I just don\\'t think sweet goes with salmon. For about the same price, I would rather have gotten another order of the lobster.\\n\\nI did have a really good non-alcoholic drink here. It was called Umbrella Not Included ($8). It was a mix of pineapple, pomegranate, lime, orgeat and ginger ale. One of the better mocktails I\\'ve had.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the panna cotta ($12). It was prettier than it tasted.\\n\\nI felt prices were kinda high here for the level of food they\\'re serving.\\n\\nI would just come back for drinks and the lobster.	1	1	1

We ate brunch here and they have everything from sushi..to egg and chorizo flautas (which I particularly liked) to deep fried twinkies.. to a nice selection of hand carved, bone in meats. Your $ includes the regular variety of sodas..teas and coffee..plus an All You Can Drink Mimosa Bar. The wait in line was minimal. As was the wait at the Omelet counter.  Overall a decent buffet meal and the staff is not in a hurry to rush you off your table when your finished eating. (I\\'ve had other places take the plates right out from under my forked fisted hand..mid bite!) Worth a try if you\\'ve got a decent appetite.	0	0	1

After a dismal buffet at a pretentious  strip hotel, this buffet renewed my faith that there are still inexpensive finds in Vegas.\\nI had the Sunday brunch buffet. It was a couple of bucks more than their normal breakfast, but the selections were phenomenal. Flat iron steaks cooked perfectly, pork onion gravy for the chicken fried steaks, gumbo, jumbalaya, ribs and more ribs. Crawfish! Every dish I tried felt the gave it special attention. Their gelato dessert area rivals the Rio. And for sunday brunch, there\\'s a chocolate fountain and sparkling wine.\\nKudos Orleans! 4 stars to food, bumped to 5 for cost and service	1	0	1

I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead. \\n\\nHere\\'s the salient-\\n\\nService\\nThe Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I\\'m from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch. \\n\\nFood\\n- The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.\\n- The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \\n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\\n- The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.	0	0	0

They have everything you need to cook an Indian meal! \\n\\nWe came here to check out the place and to our surprise we discovered a small fast food eatery inside this grocery store. So today we came back to try the food here. We ordered the curried potatoes, lentils, rice and vegetable samosas. I think my favorite is the samosa. You get two huge samosa served with mint and tamarind sauce! The best part of this is the samosa is only $1.99! \\n\\nI am definitely coming back for more samosa later.	6	7	5

The house fried rice with pork is so good you can\\'t stop eating it.  The chickens wings could have been spicier but were tasty.  I definitely have more things to try on the menu so will be back.

Can\\'t complain, all you can eat crawfish + only $11 for dinner. This isn\\'t some fancy fusion bellagio $50 buffet, this is just good simple affordable food. Been here many times with family, many of the locals go here too. Compared to the price of other buffets, can\\'t complain, service is always average and better. When you spent all your cash on clubs, crap tables, and your drunk off your a$$ this hits the spot.	1	1	1

Loved the spicy tuna & spicy surimi crab, but wasn\\'t crazy about the smoked salmon. The cashier was super informative gave us samples of their new taro chips and a 15% off coupon for our next visit. Returned the next day and split the Long Beach burrito, did without the guac, and absolutely loved it. Had taro chips & queso with sake sangria. So sad their isn\\'t a jaburrito near my tometown on the east coast. Highly recommend!	0	0	0

It\\'s totally right up our alley - great craft beer selection, great food, awesome view, dope music, and family friendly! Located right in front of the Paris Hotel, with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Our kiddo enjoyed the games provided and the Bruno Mars/JT playlist, he sure loves to dance! It was about 95 degrees out that evening but the misters, fans and ice cold beers made it feel very pleasant up there. Beers were on the pricey side but that\\'s to be expected of the location. No complaints there. We ordered the Loaded Tots, although it could have been more \\"loaded\\". I had to ask for an extra side of beer cheese and bacon. That was probably the only negative of the night but the service, delicious cold brews and great vibes made up for it. We also ordered the crinkle cut fries for our tot and he was all about them. Good fries + lots of games = happy kid. Happy kid = HAPPY MOMMA AND DADDY! =)\\n\\nWhen we arrived for our reservation, the hostess initially told us that children weren\\'t allowed that night because there would be a DJ playing that evening and the cut-off time was 8pm. Any other time would have been fine. I totally understood, and kindly just said I had wished we were informed that when I made the reservation. Before walking away, the hostess tells me, \\"You know what, hold on. Let me talk to my manager and see what we could do.\\" A few moments later she returns and tells us the manager said it would be fine to bring in my tot, as long as we could be done by 11pm. Perfect! We were done around 10:30pm. I was so appreciative that she took the time to ask her manager, rather than just sending us away. Now that\\'s great customer service. I can\\'t remember her name...Kailani perhaps?.. but a big thank you to her. She was such a friendly hostess. The service for the rest of the evening was superb as well. We are definitely hitting up Beer Park every time we visit Las Vegas! \\n\\nConveniently located right below Beer Park was HEXX Chocolate & Confexxions. Uhm..YUM! Perfect spot to grab some dessert afterward (or before!). Our tot enjoyed running amuck in there. It was a perfect ending to a perfect family fun Friday night!	1	1	0

It would\\'ve got five stars but the seating is awful and the chairs are so uncomfortable.  Like standard wood chairs that are too tall for the tables.  My back literally hurts from sitting there on that cheap chair.  Pretty unfortunate that the place that devoted so much time to detail incredible copper silverware didn\\'t look at how awful their chairs and seating are.    Probably other places I would check out at city center first	0	0	0

I was very pleased to see they had Bulgogi on the menu. I ordered it along with a slice of carrot cake.\\n\\nThe Bulgogi was so tough it was almost impossible to eat. It came with rice which appeared to have been reheated several times, and a small ear of corn which was so waterlogged it was completely inedible.\\n\\nThe carrot cake was dry and appeared to be several days beyond the freshness expiration.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the place is cute and the people are very friendly. It\\'s possible their other dishes are delicious and I just ended up with really bad food tonight. But because it was as bad as it was, I will never give them another chance.	1	2	0

A group of seven of us had just got done bowling at Sam\\'s Town and were looking to get our \\"after drinking grub\\" on. It was around 1am when we sat and began our wait....and I mean WAIT!!! We starting timing the waitress on our phones to see how long it was going to take her to get our order...10 minutes and a solid minute before we were going to leave. After that we waited another 10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered, well some of us that is. Me and two other friends ordered coffee and after waiting twenty minutes to see her start to walk over with it we all realized there was not enough in the pot for all of us. So my friend waited another 10 minutes before he actually got his coffee. My friend and I that did get coffee originally were already done with our coffee when he finally got some....uuggghhh!! Our friends that ordered soda both complained that something didn\\'t taste right and switched too water. AND that was just the drinks:( \\n\\nNow the food is the only part of this review that i gave stars to. Not for it\\'s promptness or fantastical value because it had neither but for the fact that it was hot and filled up my alcohol laden belly as wished. It was good....when we finally got it:( \\n\\nTo set things into perspective...when we got there another large group of six sat down at the same time as us. When we were sitting there wondering if we would ever get our food or coffee for the lone one of  us that still hadn\\'t gotten any they were gone and fed!!!! What a crappy experience at a normally very good place...disappointed that i brought my friends there for their first time and our waitress sucked!!! Must have had something to do with the 18% tip she tacked on our bill:{	0	0	0

I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \\n\\nWe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \\n\\nThe service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don\\'t remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \\n\\nVery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo\\'s craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \\n\\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don\\'t eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \\n\\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \\n\\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \\n\\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn\\'t doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.	1	0	0

The Cesar salad was the highlight of the meal and still one of the best I\\'ve ever had. The steak was just OK. The sides were quite good but it is a steakhouse so I was expecting something much better. The deserts were not bad just not mind blowing. For the price, unfortunately it was not worth it.	0	1	0

On Spring Mountain, there\\'s probably like a billion Pho places to try, but I think this was the one my parents recommended me when I moved to Vegas.\\n\\nThe moment I walked in, a Nujabes song was playing and I thought to myself, \\"HOLY CRAP, THIS IS AWESOME!\\" Then I was greeted by a woman who worked there that was sitting on the side talking with her friends. The moment I spoke in Vietnamese, hospitality increased by 10 times. They started to talk to me asking me what I\\'m doing in Vegas and why my Vietnamese was good. (I personally think I\\'m not that great...)\\n\\nThe interior looked pretty decent and clean and I ended up talking with the owners for a little bit more. In the end, they invited me to their friend\\'s spa that\\'s having a potluck and said it would be a good opportunity to meet more Vietnamese people. (I felt like it was also a sales pitch, but I\\'m a bit of a loner since I moved here.)\\n\\nWell anyway, I ended up ordering Pho Dac Biet to go. When I got home it looked like the standard Pho. Bloody meat, Bo Vien, basil, lime, you know the usual! The moment I tasted it I realized the difference compared to the other Pho places. The broth didn\\'t give off this unusually sweet taste that the others use which is a huge plus to me. Even the tripe was easy to eat and not hard like some places.\\n\\nThis place deserves the 4 stars, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of that incredibly sweet broth, go elsewhere, but to me, this is perfect.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll come back when I don\\'t feel like cooking at home. :]\\n\\n\\nPro tip: Learn Vietnamese, your score on the service will increase.	0	0	0

I was amazed how nice the restaurant was and semi quiet especially since its located at the Bellagio Conservatory. You cant even hear the big crowds outside. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. \\n\\nI decided on the Cookbook Tasting Menu and my BF got the Far Niente Menu (which changes seasonal).\\n\\nCookbook Tasting Menu ($108 per person):\\n\\n1. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love Ahi Tuna so I am biased but the tuna was really fresh and tasty.\\n\\n2. Mini Maine Lobster Pot Pie - MY FAVORITE. I wish I got the BIGGER lobster pot pie but its okay. The crust wasnt oily and there were plenty of potatoes and spinach. i would definitely order this again. \\n\\n3. Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Shellfish dumpling - My least fav because I am not a fish person. The sea bass wasnt kinda salty but definitely loved the broth.  \\n\\n4. Loire American Kobe Ribeye with Foie Gras - Definitely a new taste for me. I enjoyed the Kobe ribeye and it was cook medium rare. It was my first time trying foie gras and its something i have to get use too. I really liked the potato cake though. YUM! \\n\\n5. Tasting dessert menu - Man, by the time dessert came i didnt even want to look at food. but i loved the root beer float and the warm chocolate cookies. \\n\\nI would definitely come here again. I am so glad my BF took me to Michael Mina. It was a perfect ending for our trip. I recommend ordering their tasting menus for first timers like myself because if i ever come back i am going to order from their entree or ala cart menu.	1	0	1

Thought the seafood pasta dish was excellent with the right amount of zing to its tasty sauce and ample fish, shrimp, etc.  The sea bass on the other hand was a disaster.  It was very dry presumably because it was grossly overcooked, and lacked flavor.   Rib eye steak was tasty but a step down from a real quality steak house.  Tried some appetizers including the salmon cold dish, and was not at all impressed with the chefs attempt to turn the salmon into something special ( I consider myself a sushi connoisseur ).   Had a Mac n cheese side dish and was somewhat surprised to find small bits of pineapple floating throughout.  In my opinion the pineapple was not a pleasant surprise and simply detracted from a dish that I consider rich comfort food.  In retrospect I should have sent the sea bass back, but felt my doing so would impact our guests who were here from Korea.	0	1	0

However, with all these options now (monta, fukumimi, sora) all my rankings got a bit jacked up.  \\n\\nCame here and ordered the buta-san ramen along with the chicken wings for an appetizer.  Like bachi burger, i can tell this place uses some quality ingredients.  My heavenly pork? i think that\\'s what they called it was pretty tasty but it didn\\'t mesh too well with the broth, i prefer the traditional chasu instead.\\n\\nThe chicken wings were fried pretty intensely but i cant complain cause i love fried goodness.\\n\\nOverall, the soup could been hotter, and the broth was a bit too fatty as you can see chunks of white fat floating around.\\n\\ndefinitely would try again though.	2	0	0

I would do anything to not have more people learn about this gem so I can go there as much as I do and still not have to wait.\\n\\nOkay, so the service isn\\'t always the best, but who cares when the pho and the banh mi is beyond good. For all you vegetarians, they have the ultra elusive vegetable broth pho that tastes amazing and is always available. For everyone else, the rest of the pho is just as amazing with just the right amount of salt.\\n\\nNow the banh mi. Holy Vietnamese sandwich! I\\'ve had it at a ton of places and this one is by far the best. Everything, including price, is so good.\\n\\nFinally, don\\'t go here so I can always get in with no wait. Thank you.	0	0	0

The wait time for food was horrible. I\\'m not talking about the wait to be seated, I\\'m talking from the time we ordered until we got our food...over 30 minutes. My buddy was there with me and we both ordered, when his food was ready they just put it to the side to wait for mine, needless to say his food was not hot and was only warm.  This place is over priced and after eating less than half my food I gave up and just threw the rest away	0	0	0

Off the strip, not too crowded, on Fremont Street but somehow not too tourist and solid prices. If you\\'re sick of the overpriced, gaudy strip experiences then this is the place. Ordered the pad kee mow with chicken: service was prompt and friendly; noodles perfectly cooked. You can designate spiciness on a 1-5 scale. I\\'m not very adventurous with spiciness but I like some kick. So 2 was perfect. Cocktails and beer were great too.	0	0	0

So far, I\\'ve tried the tonkotsu, black garlic, and curry ramen. Tonkotsu and curry are tasty and really good. Couldn\\'t say the same for black garlic since I compare it to the one in Silverlake Ramen, Los Angeles. I suggest the mgmt send a team out there to try it out and possibly mimic that recipe. Some people like it though, so I guess it\\'s personal preference. \\n\\nSide salad and gyoza are always good. Fried rice looks bomb but never really tried it. All other sides are simple yet fitting for a ramen house. \\n\\nService needs some shaping up but understandable since they just opened. I mostly care about food quality and value for money, so my rating is based on that.	0	0	0

We had the grilled jumbo squid, cod delight and the tiger maki roll. I recommend all of these. Not only was everything tasty, but the presentation was also top notch which made the food all the more enticing.  It is obvious they take pride in what they serve. And for a new place I was pleased the already smooth service. I will be back soon to try other menu options!	3	1	1

The meal was rich, decadent, and as everything I imagined it to be! I even split the steak and left very, very full. The foie gras reminded me of when I ate my way through eastern Europe 4 years ago. I\\'ve had a really tough time finding comparable seared foie gras State-side until I came here.\\n\\nAll of the sides were delicious. I think I had the creamed corn, spinach, and mushrooms.\\n\\nSkip the BBQ shrimp. It was a big disappointment coming from a man who prides himself in creole/cajun cooking.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is really intimate. The ceilings are low and vaulted, so it\\'s like you\\'re in an underground church or something. My one gripe is that it\\'s a little noisy because of the set up. \\n\\nOf course, the service was wonderful, as expected. We were a group of 12 or so girls, there for a bachelorette party, and they handled us efficiently and graciously.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great place to go if you\\'re up on poker and want to splurge on a big slice of meat!	1	0	0

The food is not worth the price that you pay. I had Thanksgiving dinner with my family and the food selection was lacking as was the flavor. It was the first time that I was dissatisfied with MGM Grand. Vegas has so many amazing buffets but this is not one I would ever recommend. The dessert selection was poor, the food looked unappealing and tasted even worse. At one point the buffet was excellent but this was many years ago. I don\\'t plan on ever going back to this buffet. Save your money and go somewhere else.	0	0	0

But the only upsides i could give were the Shrimp Tempura crunch roll, and the tasty chicken Katsu. \\n\\nI walked in with my girlfriend around noon to have some AYCE goodness. 21.95 is a bit high, but a few dollars isn\\'t too big of a deal. But my experience wouldn\\'t bring me back. There were 2 or 3 other people in the restaurant, and while we were eating, a few groups came in, sat down and left without eating. I have no idea why.\\n\\nWe started off with miso soup. My girlfriend was fond of it, as for me it tasted a bit runny and a little on the downside of flavor, but it was the right temperature and it was just ok. The sushi was fair and like i said, the crunch roll was tasty and had to be the best roll that lunch. They do not have half orders, I prefer half orders because if there were to be a roll i did not like, there would be a small portion to finish, and also half orders get you to try all of the different kinds of sushi they have to offer. So this place is better for groups.\\n\\nService was definitely fast, the lady who served us was nice and friendly but she seemed rushed in a way that you would see as if you were late to class. I don\\'t like seeing someone in a hurry or having that panicking look.\\n\\nOverall just an A-OK Not really much to say about this place. I may come back with a bigger group or find a different AYCE sushi place.	0	0	0

Speed was efficient.  Service was considerably good.  Friendly & helpful staff.   Of the 7 days stay at Caesar for a conference, we had tried their paste, salmon special, some burger and fries, fish and chips, flat-bread  appetizer & pot sticker.  \\n\\nAx the board, their food quality were consistent and were above and beyond other restaurants of the same franchise.  In fact, we liked their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost every day we stayed there. \\n\\nI am giving a 4 star for their location, and for $ value with respect to their overall food quality and services.  Would recommend for families and individuals on budget / biz trip.	1	0	0

The menu has varied offerings, plus great sides like fried sweet potato. You can just about pick your toppings and the best part is the burger itself. It is homemade style and is smashed on the grill and cooked when you order. The meat is tasty and fresh, the 1/2 pounder is a belly full. Nice old fashioned shakes and malts. At the end of the day this is not a gourmet burger, but very high on the fast food scale.	0	0	0

I definitely recommend making reservations if you\\'re going around 7-9pm and want to sit in their cozy booths that make you feel like you\\'re inside a wooden barrel. They had a variety of choices on the menu to choose from. From sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked items. You can either do a la carte or pick from a 10 course dinner [$29.99] or 12 course dinner [$39.99] . As well as ayce for $80 which is steep or they had some other cheaper sets as well. The boyfriend and I chose to both do the 12 course. They bring out a piece of paper and for each course you get to choose which item you want from their list. I chose garlic edamame, hamachi w/jalapeño, agedashi tofu, oysters [4 on the halfshell], soba salad with salmon skin [there were soba noodles in it! Pretty interesting], salmon bowl, tempura mix [shrimp and veggies], salmon teriyaki, sukiyaki [noodles, sliced beef, tofu, veggies in hot sweet broth], blue diamond roll, miso soup, and to finish off I had condensed milk shaved ice. I\\'d definitely recommend this place for someone who\\'s looking for something different. Only thing I\\'d change is the wait time on food.. After half way through we both got over waiting for another item to come but I see why they do that so you have time to enjoy your current dish. Everything was good and we definitely had stuff leftover to take home!	1	0	0

Noodles were awful, broth was bland and boring in one dish and too spicy in another dish. Waitress also couldn\\'t communicate the menu properly and didn\\'t say that the ramen I ordered would have shaved chilies in it. Only reason I gave it stars is because the restaurant had a nice ambiance and the other waitress seemed attentive to her customers. Also it took forever to get the check. Never going back.

We decided on these options from their prix fixe menu along with wine pairings, and, of course, the two of us shared.\\n\\nHe ordered: Tomato Soup with Lobster, Filet of Beef, and Michael\\'s Root Beer Float.\\nThe tomato soup was good, but not anything special. I have to admit that I didn\\'t have enough of the beef to provide a fair opinion, and I don\\'t like root beer so I\\'ll leave that alone as well.\\n\\nI ordered: Wagyu Short Rib Ravioli, Phyllo-Crusted Sole, and the Candy Bar.\\nI was expecting the Wagyu ravioli to be amazing (c\\'mon, short ribs), but it just tasted like what you\\'d think it tastes like. The sole was actually my favorite of the dishes because it was like butter. The downside was that the crust had a floury texture to it. Finally, the candy bar dessert was tasty, but a little too rich even for a chocolate lover.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can\\'t remember the names of the different wines we had, but they did pair them very well so kudos to the team for that. Overall, the food was average. Nothing was bad, but each dish just seemed to be missing its own spark.

It also happens to be next to a Nike Town and a Virgin Megastore. Not to mention, a really huge and cool aquarium. I like coming here after a long day of wasting money at Caesar\\'s. Also, I think the Cajun Rib-eye is the best kept secret in the business. Why? Its better than an outback porterhouse, by far, its not too expensive, and it has a huge serving size.

Our recent visit, which was my first, was nothing to rave about...\\n\\nFrom the moment we walked in, to the second we walked out, there was no customer service whatsoever. Ya know how a lot of places ask you if you\\'d been there before, and if not, they\\'ll explain it to you. Not at Parsley. They won\\'t even say hi to you and ask what you want, just kinda blankly stare at you until you figure it out on your own.\\n\\nI went with the steak bowl, and moving down the line felt like I should\\'ve thrown my wallet over the counter and walked away. You want extra meat? $3-$4. Extra sauce? That\\'ll cost the you a buck. A little cheese? $1. Olives sound good? Another $1. Everyone likes a dollop of hummus on their bowl, right? You guessed it, fork over another Washington. The bowl already cost $9 and let me tell you, they aren\\'t heavy handed with really anything in there, especially the meats. If you\\'re feeling hungry, I feel bad for ya son...because it won\\'t be a cheap lunch.\\n\\nWas the bowl good? Eh, it was alright. The flavors were decent, and everything tasted fairly fresh. But all it really is, is a salad with a few toppings on it. Certainly not worth nearly $10. Add on crappy service with rude employees, I\\'ll pass on Parsley.	7	1	1

I went on a Tuesday around 1 PM and it wasn\\'t packed at all. I sat at the bar and the server wasn\\'t very attentive at all. She seemed very preoccupied and flustered but there was literally only a handful of people in the restaurant. \\n\\nAs for the food, I ordered the burger that had Mac and cheese on it. I substituted the beef patty for turkey. Overall, the burger was bland and the macaroni was average at best. The fries were delicious though!\\n\\nI also ordered two shots and a goblet (what was I thinking?!) The goblet was very fruity and I only drank half and it got the job done. My bill came to $70 I believe but I had a groupon deal which knocked it down to $40. Pretty expensive but typical for Vegas.\\n\\nI would definitely return, try something else on the menu, and probably sit at a table instead of the bar.	0	0	0

Service is top notch \\nWe had the signature tasting menu with the wine pairing. \\n\\n1.) Caviar Parfait 7/10. I\\'ve had better caviar, but this one paired well with the champagne. \\n\\n2.) Ahi Tuna 9/10- Amazing. I love the preparation. It had just the right amount of sesame.\\n\\n3.) Sea Bass 10/10- This was by far my favorite dish. The dashi was so succulent (I wanted seconds after this dish!)\\n\\n4.) Lobster pot pie (4/10)- I don\\'t understand this dish. The lobster was chewy and dry. The dish is way too rich and salty.\\n\\n5.) Wagyu Ribeye  8/10 - Amazing Rib eye, but the foie pairing was too much at this point after eating the lobster pot pie.\\n\\nDessert wasn\\'t too memorable. I can\\'t remember what we had.	0	0	0

There was nothing I couldn\\'t finish, but I have had a better version of each at other restaurants. The sushi had an odd texture when I tried it and was my least favorite of the specials, and I feel like it was a bit \\"fishier\\" than comparable sushi joints in the area. The tonkatsu bento was my favorite, with everything crispy and flavorful, and I love the miso that comes with their lunch specials. (It comes with what I can only describe as a \\"seaweed medly\\" and the different textures are quite pleasant. The food looks absolutely gorgeous, and the portions are just the right size, however the taste just wasn\\'t the most memorable for me. My co-workers love the place, though, so maybe I just haven\\'t hit the right menu item. I will probably be back, and definitely update the review with another star if I find a favorite.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little odd. It strikes me as sort of \\"west elm\\" catalog, which isn\\'t bad, just unexpected from a thai/japanese place, and really, a restaurant in general for me, and the jazz soundtrack reminds me a bit of Richard Cheese songs. That being said, it\\'s very cozy, with nice, squishy chairs, and I felt quite comfortable and welcomed. \\n\\nThe wait staff is awesome, and put up with my fussy co-worker admirably, and even let me know about their free-thai tea with yelp check in. The price is right for lunch at around $10/person, but for me, the food wasn\\'t enough to take it from \\"A-OK\\" to \\"Yay!\\".	1	0	0

I never ate in a deli before so this was my first experience.  Boy am I glad I went!  This place is always busy for lunch, so that\\'s a pretty good sign the food is good.\\n\\nTheir menu was big, with lots of sandwiches, po\\'boy subs, paninins, BIG (I mean like almost foot long big) baked potatoes, soups, wraps, pasta, and even a full service salad bar with all the fixins\\'.  I had never been there before so I asked what suggestions they had.  The order taker told me to try the \\'New York Yankee\\'.  It is a sandwich made with pastrami and corned beef on rye bread, with Swiss cheese and mustard.  It also came with chips and a pickle.  It was a great first choice, this bad boy was huge!  The sandwich itself was like 6 inches in height.  The pastrami and corned beef were moist and flavorful, and went great with the Swiss and rye.  Not half bad for only $7.99.\\n\\nTheir sweet tea is pretty bomb too, almost as good as Raising Cane\\'s.  Cane\\'s is better mainly because of their pellet-shaped ice.  Their salad bar is nothing to laugh at either.  Lots of fresh choices, and even whole hard-boiled eggs which were great (unlike Sweet Tomatoes where they shred it up).  They even have free Garlic Toast and mini muffins, as well as various crackers that are complimentary to all patrons.  Not just that...but they also have free soft serve ice cream!  Well, free if you buy something to eat.  On second thought, I never asked if ice cream came with everything on the menu.  I kinda just helped myself to the machine everytime I ate there.  Nonetheless, I never got busted for it.  So.....therefore, it must be free!\\n\\nNot a bad place to have a great lunch with a bunch of your friends.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I went there recently for dinner and found out the portions aren\\'t quite what they used to be.  It was rather slow with no one in there.  Instead of my 6 inch high sandwich, this time is was maybe an inch shorter.  Boo.  This time the soft serve ice cream machine was broken too.  Double Boo.  So stick to this place for lunch, with busier crowds they tend to do better food.	3	2	3

We hoped that it would be consistent with the quality we have come to enjoy like the one in Waikiki on Oahu.\\n\\nWe were not disappointed.  We started with a few appetizers, the crab artichoke dip is the best!  My wife had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (with a Thai Curry flair) and I had the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  Both were outstanding, and highly recommended!\\n\\nThe hostess was very courteous, and our waitress was extremely attentive.  The only disappointment was not having time to stay for dessert!  We had to leave en route to a 7 p.m. show of the Jersey Boys playing at the Paris Hotel!  That was also a 5 star experience!	0	0	0

Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.	1	1	1

First off, this is a great dive bar and truly a hidden gem with great prices, great atmosphere, and really friendly staff but the food is where it\\'s at. I had the biryani bowl and it didn\\'t disappoint. Spicy, flavorful, and filling for a great price!\\n\\nEverything about the experience was pleasantly surprising and our whole group left feeling like we had stumbled upon an amazing secret, which is a shame because in any big city atmosphere this place would be packed every single night.\\n\\nIf you are in the area and are hungry or just want to grab a couple drinks and play some pool or shuffleboard, couldn\\'t recommend this place enough.	1	0	0

We had never been before, so b-in-law went ahead and planned out an itenerary for us.  We ate at the MGM Grand Buffet on the first night of the trip Monday b/c it was the most convenient (we stayed at MGM Grand Hotel).\\n\\nShort wait in line (5-10 min).  Cost was upwards of $120 for 2 adults and 2 kids :(\\n\\nNice sized selection including American, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Indian. I liked that they had whole asian pears\\n\\nFood was very hit or miss.  I would have expected much better quality for the price.  Steamed dim sum dumplings were cold and dried out. Miso soup was devoid of tofu and sooo salty.  Chinese \\'rice balls\\' were awfully dried out and sitting in a thick sauce that was so salty that I could not eat it.  I am the sort of person who has 3-4 different types of specialty salt at home and sometimes even carries my sea salt grinder in my purse, so it is really bad if something is that salty to me! Fried tofu balls were better, lighter and fluffier than any fried tofu that I have previously had elsewhere.  Sesame balls were hot enough for the sesame seeds to be all hot and toasty - yum :)\\n\\nDesserts selection was pretty decent.  All of the desserts (fruit tarts, custards, etc) that I tried were delicious, though still not quite worth the price...\\n\\nMy favorite part was the asian pear.  My husband does not remember eating anything impressive, but is still grumping about the cost.  My oldest son loved the mints that he got as we were leaving.\\n\\nAll in all, not worth the $$.  For a few bucks less you can get a far superior buffet experience at Wicked Spoon (our fave meal of the trip).	0	0	0

The solo, lonely pickle on the plate has been abolished and now all sandwich ordering patrons can load up on pickles at the salad bar. They are decent pickles with a good crunch. Just imagine if every sandwich you ate in your lifetime came with unlimited pickles, how many per sandwich would you eat? I downed 7 of them with my $6.99 Papa Joe. The sandwich was turkey with roma tomato and pesto aioli and was good, despite being small as it was shoved onto a square of Herb Foccica bread about toilet paper size. There are places with better turkey around, so unless you love pickles, this chain will only be necessary when in a bind. Salad bar is good too on a previous visit, but just throw some chicken or protein on the thing and stop nicle and diming us for everything up there (pickles was just a start).	0	0	0

I arrived at RE tapas at 9:00 on a friday.  The live music seemed to be good, but when I asked to be seated, the hostess told me that two cooks quit and it would be a 30 minute wait.  I think this is ridiculous when the restaurant was not that busy.  I then asked if we could sit down and have a few drinks before we ordered.  She looked around and said no.  This place will not be in business for long treating customers like this.  She told me the kitchen was backed up.  In these tough economic times, customer service should be priority one!!!!	0	2	1

Needless to say, we were all very unimpressed by the selection of food here. It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did 1 dish. I wasn\\'t motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn\\'t make up for the meal.\\n\\nI had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You\\'d need several to feel like you\\'re eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn\\'t expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?\\n\\nNothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them. Next time I\\'m in town I\\'ll play it safe and come for lunch if things seem different.\\n\\nActually, no. I\\'m going back to Bacchanal.	8	2	0

We like veggies, even when we are on vacay and this is a great spot to get food that won\\'t leave you constipated the next day. (I\\'m a nurse, so I realize that these sort of conversations are hard for people, but they also reflect reality :-)\\n\\nWe like to feel good, even on vacation and Parsely\\'s gives you lots options to feel good. This place is teaming with healthy, fit people (and the cute chubbies as well) because the veg is fresh and aplenty and the price is so good. We totally pigged out for $40 including tax and baklava but usually your price per person is abou $10. Our reco\\'s: Falafel salad with their spicy red sauce. It needs the heat because it healthily does not have a lot of salt. Add some babaganoush, taziki, and hummus (usually you pay $1 extra per side unless it is automatically included) and you\\'ve got yourself quite the  Mediterranean spread. The Hummus plate is great as wel. Just the Hummus with pita chips is worth getting. Their fresh pita chips are soo good. \\n\\nDon\\'t forget the Cucumber Chiller for $1.99. The yellow curry is fabulous as well, rice is seasoned so well you could eat it by itself. Next time I\\'m going to get the Nachos. Yum.	5	3	5

So of course I had to eat at the factory! \\n\\nI went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn\\'t judging the food at that age. \\n\\nMy husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn\\'t take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter??? \\n\\nWe ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well. \\n\\nAnd for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose. \\n\\nAll in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it! \\n\\nIf I could change one thing, I would have them start taking reservations! \\n\\nI will be back for many years to come! Enjoy all!	3	2	2

We really over indulged but we had a voucher that needed to be used in its entirety or lose it. We started by meeting our waiter, Joel. He made this a really good experience for us. Got our drinks, beer and wine. Then he explained everything on the menu plus informed us that there would be a lot of food. We ordered the black bean salmon, spring rolls, pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, 5 spice soup, veggie & mushroom, steamed rice, crispy noodles with shrimp chow mein. Topped it off with their lychee custard. Oh my god! We ate like pigs and brought enough home for two more servings. All of this for a hundred bucks! Can\\'t wait to go back for more.	0	0	0

It\\'s a small restaurant in the Red Rock casino and opened I think in December. We were seated promptly and the restaurant was almost full. It took about 10 mins before a wait staffer appeared but once he did he provided us excellent service, I watched as he was extremely busy, always on the move and never wasting a minute standing around as I noticed a couple of the other waiters doing. We started with the Mochiko chicken appetizer, it was very good with a slight crunch and mildly sweet garlicky flavor. Next was the Pork Belly bao which was delicious in a super soft bun and finally  I had the chilled vermicelli noodle bowl which was good as I find most of the grilled pork in these types of noodle bowls either not \\"grilled\\" or  too sweet, the pork was grilled and had a mild sweetness to it, the only thing lacking in this entree that kept it from being perfect was the fish sauce flavor, it had none that I could detect in the nuoc cham sauce. My partner had the wonton soup and found it to be good but not memorable and could have used a few more wontons in it as it only had 3. It was not a dish he would order again.	0	0	0

They have a wide selection of foods: DIY noodle bar (pho, laksa, ramen, udon, etc.), sushi (small selection), Chinese dimsum, stir-fry and congee, anti-pasto, American soups, DIY taco bar, dessert island (pastries,cake, gelato, cookies, fruit, etc.), seafood bar, Italian section, fast food items, and the meat section. I love the DIY taco bar because it tasted better than expected for a buffet. The price is reasonable considering the wide assortment and quality of foods. I would definitely recommend if you\\'re looking for a buffet in Vegas!	0	0	0

We tried the Miso ramen & Black garlic ramen. Both were quite good. Huge bowls! Priced decently. If you ask for soda, it\\'s cans. They should probably invest in a soda machine, that would be better. Great news is the place was packed at lunch time! So nice to see a small business over here doing so well! Definitely recommend!	1	0	0

At first glance its your standard store front in chinatown. But the aroma and atmosphere inside is unlike any other. Wait time is next to non existent for lunch, and the owner/employees are very nice. If your ever in the neighborhood and you have an itch for good pho at a very good price, stop in! The broth is so deep and flavorful if they bottled it I would drink it instead of water. The food service is relatively fast as well.	0	0	0

Also, he tried to just skip over the sauce and veggies till I told him to hold on and add some stuff...\\n\\nGot a tuna bowl and falafel plate again and they definitely gave a heartier more sufficient portion this time. Would I come back? Maybe if I am in the area since there aren\\'t many relatively healthy, quick options nearby. Would I come out of my way to come here? Definitely not! It is totally hit or miss with customer service, portion size, etc.	3	2	3

But here, they make perfect sense.\\n\\nMGM Grand mercifully serves \\"Brunch\\" until 4:00 PM on Weekends, just in case you slept in. Which you probably did.\\n\\nTheir brunch consists of a pretty nice selection of acceptable breakfast items, including eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, omlette station, etc. It\\'s all ok, but none of it is amazing. \\n\\nThey also offer a lot of their regular dinner stuff too. Slices of turkey breast at the carving station, pasta, salad, Mexican food, desert bar, and quite a bit more. Again, none of the food was amazing, but none of it offensive either. \\n\\nI had a brilliant idea too late to utilize it: breakfast tacos! They had taco shells and a bunch of stuff to make normal tacos with, BUT you could combine that with the breakfast stuff (bacon, eggs, hash browns, etc) and make breakfast tacos! Unfortunately, I had this stroke of genious as I was about to have an actual stroke at the end of the meal, and I couldn\\'t possibly eat another bite. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the greatest food, and it wasn\\'t the greatest thing for me health-wise, but I won\\'t lie: if I were at the MGM Grand at breakfast time again, I\\'d be right back in there. I\\'ll be the guy with the breakfast tacos...	7	6	5

It used to be one of the best places to chow down with family and friends. The quality has slipped a bit and the lines have declined. \\n\\nWith the consolidation of most hotels to pretty much four main companies in the strip, buffets no longer have a uniqueness to them. \\n\\nI remember being amazed as a child but as an adult and after visited other buffets in Vegas, I was sad to see that this place has lost a bit of its luster. \\n\\nI will add though that the service has always been great! \\n\\nIf you\\'re in the MGM and have a huge appetite, then you\\'ve come to the right place. \\n\\nIf you play slots or tables, you\\'ll want to join their players card and earn a free meal as well as discounts to their rooms. What\\'s good is you can earn comps at any of the MGM properties and redeem at their other spots.\\n\\nDepending on your status you may not have to wait long in line.	1	1	1

We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes.\\n\\nWhen the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don\\'t worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass.\\n\\nOverall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn\\'t all that exciting anyway.	0	2	0

We surprisingly were able to get reservations the same afternoon at 5:00 pm when it opened.  We were immediately seated by a window seat that we had requested.\\n\\nAtmosphere is nice, service was very good to excellent. Waiter was friendly and reassured us that he would try to have us out in time to attend a show. When I asked what was a particular garnish, he went and re-checked with the kitchen to be sure.  \\n\\nWe had the three course pre-theater menu ($68).  Both my friend and I were looking forward to the butternut squash soup that was on the menu (as well as on line).  Unfortunately, the waiter did not mention that they did not have it until we were ordering.  We had the alternative soup that was not listed which was a celery heart soup with a small crab cake in the center of the soup.  It didn\\'t  sound as appealing to me but it was excellent!  Presentation of the soup was very nice with two waiters pouring the soup at the table from two small individual containers.  I would order it again!\\n\\nI had the fresh sour dough bread .  My friend and I were surprised that there was not a glutton free alternative.  Something else small should have been offered to my friend to nibble on, especially as I was eating my bread and she just sat there waiting for the soup to arrive.  I was surprised that the bread waiter did not come back to offer a second bread or replenish the butter.\\n\\nWe both ordered the sea bass.  My friend loved her dish!   I often cook broiled sea bass so I was surprised that the sea bass came in a light Asian broth sort of like steamed Chinese fish but much better (my mistake for not reading the menu more closely). The portion of sea bass was plentiful.  There were Chinese dried black mushroom slices, Bok Choy and a tiny won ton dumpling in the broth.  The sea bass was placed upon a bed of slivered jicama.   Won ton  wrapper was sort of undercooked and the filling needed more flavoring.  Broth was flavorful.  Sea bass was tender and seasoning on top was tasty.  Bok Choy was slightly over cooked to my liking ( I eat a lot of Asian food!). . Slice of black mushroom was salty but this might have been a sprinkling of seasoning intended for the fish.  Overall the dish was a blend of salty and mostly mild tastes\\n\\nDessert was excellent!! I had the rootbeer float with chocolate pecan cookies.  Sooo good!  Cookies were warm, crispy outside with soft middle.   Root beer was well balanced with the delicious ice cream.   My friend had the vanilla Ice cream.  (Since she is glutton free she replaced  a tart with 2nd scoop of ice cream). Ice cream was refreshing with a clean vanilla flavor.\\n\\nWe were celebrating my friend\\'s birthday so they brought out a plate with \\"happy birthday\\" written on it, a candle and four small chocolate balls.   Very nice touch!  \\n\\nBest not to rush this type of dining experience.  Be sure to allow yourself at least two hours to enjoy the meal in a leisurely fashion.  (Our mistake!)\\n\\nOverall, very nice experience!!	0	0	0

What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn\\'t a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I\\'d say the food part of Emeril\\'s more or less did the trick with regards to that.\\n\\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre\\'d was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn\\'t feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre\\'d didn\\'t really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \\n\\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn\\'t fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to rip Delmonico\\'s so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn\\'t deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \\"double-baked potato\\" + \\"Asparagus\\" was fantastic.\\n\\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I\\'ve had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar\\'s Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\\n\\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \\n\\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.	2	0	0

Rice bowls sound so simple, but they\\'re comforting, fresh, and hit just the right spot when done well.\\n\\nMenu has about five different bowls, each with their own protein and complementary sauces, all with rice and veggies. The Mochiko Chicken Bowl is the only one I\\'ve tried so far and it was great- generous portion of fresh, juicy chicken with a great sauce, crisp veggies, and a scoop of rice. So long as you go in knowing it\\'s mochiko influenced and not some strictly-authentic version of the dish, you should enjoy it. There are a few sides available, one being a salad with a choice of three house-made dressings (black sesame vin was my favorite.) \\n\\nOwner and Chef Tony is a treasure- I accidentally came just after close, but he opened up, let me in, and made my tasty dinner. He\\'s charming and chatty and has some great plans for this place. I\\'ll be coming back to try their Shrimp Bayou and porkbelly bowls soon!	16	10	16

My friend told me later that when he went it was nearly 50min from the time he got in line to the time he got his food.  After much thought I settled on the Rockport since it was a guest favorite.\\n\\nThis is only the 2nd time that I\\'ve had a sushi burrito and while its enjoyable to watch them make it or have them serve it to you, thats where the more enjoyment for me laid.  The seaweed was a bit soggier than I would have liked but not bad.  My friend and I thought that the rice could have been slightly longer tho.  There is not much soft shell crab and most of what I got were legs.  The eel sauce to chipotle mayo ratio was good.	0	0	0

This plaza across from Desert Breeze Park is home to Zaytoons Mediterranean deli, The Other Mama and other great food spots, but The Rice Shop is definitely a must eat in this Plaza. \\nI was blown away, the leafy green salads were super fresh with home made dressings made from scratch. The miso sesame + wasabi ranch + chinese black bean vinaigrette were all superb! \\nThe rice bowls were perfect in every way!	3	2	2

Service was.....how do I put this, I just felt like the waitress was going through the motions.  We started with a cucumber salad for my vegetarian husband and it came with fake crab on top - I don\\'t know but I think a cucumber salad would be just that and they were going to put any kind of real or fake fish on it they would put that on the menu.  When I told her we didn\\'t want the fish on it and sent it back she looked puzzled, I told her my husband was a vegetarian so to please make sure they didn\\'t sprinkle fish flakes on his veggie rolls.  2 of us had the sushi special and it was OK, not great.  I had to fight her to take to salad off the bill.	0	0	0

The music is contemporary and not too loud. We sat in an indoor/outdoor patio overseeing the pool . Every table looks like it has its own room. The place would never look crowded. Our waiter Michael and his assistant Noah were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Michael was able to answer our questions about the cocktail menu and provide recommendations.\\nThe food, as expected, was top notch. The fries are a must.

Every now and then I am just looking for a take out treat that is just a little bit lighter. So I was really excited when I stumbled upon Taiga, and was hoping to add it to my list of options. \\n\\nLocated across from one of the entrances to Sunset Park, Taiga could easily be missed. The only thing remotely interesting in the shopping center it is located in is Sunrise Cafe (which is constantly bustling and how I found Taiga in the first place). I\\'d walked by it a dozen times, and one day after grabbing coffee decided to stop in and grab some take out. We ordered the Taiga shrimp, the garlic pork rice bowl, and the grilled octopus. They also have a basic sushi and sashimi menu, some pretty yummy sounding salads, and some other tasty looking entrees. \\n\\nThe food was definitely solid. The rice was maybe a little bit mushy, and the shrimp which were wrapped in wanton paper weren\\'t anything special, but as far as take out options go I was totally satisfied. I\\'m interested in trying some of their other menu items as well as giving dining in a go, as the restaurant is cute with dimly lit lighting and comfortable looking tables. \\n\\nOverall I would probably give them 3 and a half stars, but I\\'ll bump them up to 4 just for having take out options that I haven\\'t been able to find anywhere else. Extra points because they also deliver, and are kind enough to walk your order over to Sunrise Cafe if you would like them to. If you are craving Japanese give them a try.	0	0	0

We had a show to catch so the waiter suggested we go with the faster pre-theater menu.\\n\\nPre-theater menu $68/per person + $35/per person wine pairing\\n\\nRecommended:\\n\\nAhi Tuna Tartare (add $15 to menu price) - they mix this table side and it\\'s a nice way to wet the appetite. The tuna is fresh and the tartare mix is light and refreshing.\\n\\nLobster Pot Pie (add $32 to menu price) - I debated whether to add this to the menu, but I\\'m a lobster fan. This was served table side as well and the pie crush is served beneath the lobster. It was hearty and the presentation unique.\\n\\nService - professional, friendly and timely\\n\\nThe only deduction is that the menu lacks creativity. I opted for the \\"classic\\" Michael Mina dishes...very good but not spectacular.	2	0	1

You wouldn\\'t think much of the exterior of the place, but the interior is very rustic, giving a very down to earth environment.

I came here one day for day for lunch with some coworkers and it was perfect! Surprisingly there was hardly anyone in the place except for a few people at the bar and one older woman who had just hit the jackpot($1200) on some electronic betting games..?!!\\nAnyway our server was friendly, welcoming and on her game!  As much as she was on her game, apparently so was the kitchen!  Everything we ordered(12 oz ribeye-perfectly seasoned, Texas melt done to perfection and a Philly cheesteak that made my mouth water...\\nThe atmosphere in this place is accommodating to everyone: smokers-at the bar, those who don\\'t like to eat outside and smoke free-inside dining or outside on the patio.  \\nI recommend the patio.  The roof is done up with military camo to shade from the extreme Las Vegas sun making it a nice shady and cool oasis.  Comfortable seating as well as some tv\\'s are available for those who need it.  \\nI gave this place 4 stars only due to their lack of local beer.  Other than that I would have given it 5 stars!  \\nMaybe next time I roll thru Vegas they\\'ll have some local beer and win that 5th star from me.	0	1	0

I went with a group of 4, only 1 steak was cooked correctly and it was super fatty. I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband\\'s was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked.

Right? \\n\\nThey have a BBQ area, stir fry and make your own pasta stations, a Mexican food area and pizza and pastas. Oh and then there\\'s dessert. I think they may actually have more dessert than food options. Soft serve, cakes and pies, gelato and sorbets and my dad\\'s favorite: the bread pudding. \\n\\nI enjoyed the breakfast buffet with the omelet station and crisp bacon!  \\n\\nThe waitstaff that brought your beverages and took away your dirty plates were really nice and prompt with our drinks. \\n\\nI had to minus a star because of the cashiers. On one occasion the cashier was rude and charged us incorrectly even after we told her numerous times how many people were in our party. She was downright sassy commenting on other people being served near us \\"oh there\\'s another one, must a full mood out tonight\\".	2	1	1

The first thing I had coming off my flight from OKC to Vegas were their nachos and a margarita (9am, and I\\'m okay with that!).\\n\\n The nachos seemed expensive and then they brought them. OH DEAR GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE? I think I was going to sob because of how purely gigantic the mountain of nachos was.

Little did I know there was an all-adult version serving up cold brewskies and typical bar fare for those who woud rather waste calories on beers instead of donuts.  Because of its location, I decided to have a little Happy Hour here for some coworkers and staff.  \\n\\nThe manager, Michael, was more than accommodating and very friendly from the get-go.  I called some days ahead to give them the heads up and they let me know there was a private patio room they would seat us in.  \\n\\nWe had pre-ordered apps so they would be ready to start bringing them out as soon as we got there.  Unfortunately, the patio room had a couple of AC units that seemed to be working on overtime as they sounded like planes flying over head.  In addition, the room was very echoey so we couldn\\'t hear each other talking at all.  I could literally be sitting next to someone and if I wasn\\'t looking directly at their lips moving, I would have no idea what they were saying.\\n\\nThe food came out and it was all typical bar food.  We ordered a few appetizer platters which came with fried zucchini, 2 wings, 2 tenders, mozz sticks and I think that\\'s it.  The wings and tenders were dry and unappetizing. I was very unimpressed with the appetizer platter altogether.  We also ordered chicken quesadillas, nachos and fries, which were all decent. The nachos were my favorite.  Imagine a mountain of chips placed within a large taco salad bowl (genius, in my opinion!) and drizzled with cheese, sour cream, beans, salsa, guac and chicken.  It was perfectly warm with the right amount of each element.  It was a little messy to eat and probably awkward given the professional setting, but still yummy nonetheless.\\n\\nThe service became painfully slow as the next two hours progressed.  Our poor server was this quiet timid older woman who would manage to sneak in and out like a ninja without anyone who wanted to order a drink seeing her.  Someone would say where\\'s the waitress, and someone else would say, she just came in and grabbed some empty plates.  It went on like this all night and I had to constantly run out of the room to find her, bring her in, and yell across to room to make sure everyone got a chance to order a drink.  \\n\\nNo one ever came to buss our tables so we ended up bussing them ourselves and putting all the dirty dishes onto one table.  It was appalling.  \\n\\nIf not for the decent nachos and Michael\\'s friendliness and willingness to accommodate us, I would have given this place only two stars.  But to be honest, even with its 3 stars, I sadly will not be bringing my monthly happy hour party back here again.	0	0	0

Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Tacos, or Salad- four meats or vegetarian- ranging from $5.50 -$6.10. Needed something fast before we were picking up our new furniture at nearby Lawrence\\'s; this fit the bill. We came here once before, but my husband didn\\'t like it. This time he liked it!\\n\\nChoose the meat- chicken, steak, barbacoa (naturally raised beef), carnitas (pork) or vegetarian. Choose the burrito, burrrito bowl, tacos or salad. I really liked my chicken salad. Romaine greens, topped with medium roasted chili-corn salsa, mild- pico de gallo, chipotle chicken, peppers & onions, corn, and shredded cheese and the side of chipotle-honey vinaigrette. There was so much flavor from both salsas and the peppers & onions, that I really didn\\'t put too much additional salad dressing. (You can get it with sour cream and avocado but I thought it was fine.) It was soooo good- I finished it. My husband got the carnitas burrito- he called it a two fister- it\\'s huge, I would probably only eat half. He really enjoyed it. (He got steak the first time, but it was dry so he didn\\'t like it.)\\n\\nI recently reviewed Baja Fresh as possibly being my favorite Mexican chain restaurant, but I think that I like Chipotle better. There is a kids menu ranging from $2.95-$3.95- quesadillas, taco, or taco kit (they build it- really neat!). Also, maragaritas & beer available ($2.75- $3.50). Sides are chips & salsa, guacamole ($1.50). Free refills on soda. The inside, which is industrial feeling, reminds me of Hash House A Go Go. The staff is fast and friendly, and the inside is very clean.	0	0	0

And, this place ranks high.\\n\\nIt\\'s located in an unglamorous, partially deserted stripmall (like most delicious LV restaurants).  And then you walk in....and...okay, not glamorous inside either.  Don\\'t even go into the bathroom, trust me, you will be frightened.\\n\\nBut the food, the food.  I always order the vegetarian combo (some habits die hard) and at least one meat option.  The vegetarian combo has a great selection of dishes that includes cabbage, pureed vegetables, lentils and a salad.\\n\\nMy favorite meat dishes are the lamb tibs, gored gored,  and Kitfo. The lamb tibs and gored gored (cubed, cooked beef) are all marinated and served in delicious sauces. Do try the house Kitfo, the raw ground beef.  It may sound scary but it\\'s really just ethiopian steak tartare (I told you i\\'m a really dirty carnivore now). \\n\\nBetween two people, two entrees is wayyy more than enough to order.  All the entrees average from $8-$10 and everything is served on injera(the big, bread pancake).  Also, if you don\\'t know, eat with your right hand and use the extra injera bread as your utensils.\\n\\nPlease note that service here is at a \\"leisurely pace.\\"  Be prepared for an extended dinner as the waitresses, while super nice and pseudo attentive, are generally very busy and take a while to bring you the check.	5	5	4

Order all possible drinks and Tabasco when you sit down as you may never see your waitress again. This place is busy! Food is decent (we went at noon) but at 30 a pop I expected more variety there was lots of breakfast at that hour). \\n\\nno taco bar, No fried chicken or shrimp, No pizza!?!?

The older gentlemen who served us was amazing. He made sure to always check his guest & get them whatever they need or more. We asked for extra bowl, he brings extra bowl plus spoons plus chopsticks... Just the extra step really hit the 5 star for me. The oxtail pho was amazing!!! The broth didn\\'t need any extra sauce or siracha... It was delicious on its own. Sweet and flavorful. Next their fried rice was amaaaaaazing... I love that they added small chunks of Chinese sausage and cha lua (pork meat) plus shrimp... It tasted like mommas cooking mmmmm. The spring rolls were delicious. They had pickled veggies inside which made the flavor pop. \\n\\nThe restaurant interior was very nice as well. Very cute and cozy. I would defiantly be coming back :)	37	21	31

Yelp. App.\\n\\nThe place was easy to find, about a mile up the road from Bosa on Spring Mountain. I walked in and was seated quickly with a fine view of the large TV playing Fox News (?). Tick...tick..tick. No one came to take my order for what felt like 30 minutes, although I\\'d guess it was more like 10. I finally scooped up an order of rare steak and well done brisket pho along with an iced tea and an order of spring rolls ($12 total). \\n\\nAbout 5 min later, everything came out. Iced tea was standard. Spring roll was good and the pho....the ____ing pho....was phenomenal. The brisket wasn\\'t fatty, the rare beef didn\\'t taste like concrete and the broth was the best pho broth I\\'ve ever had. I was full early on and just kept having one more spoonful...then another...then another...then I was sweating...then I ate more...then there was none left...then I was sad. Compounding the sadness was the fact that no waiter had stopped by for another 10 minutes, so I had to stare into my empty bowl (the alternative of Fox News wasn\\'t any better). I eventually just got up and went to the register. \\n\\nI\\'m 4-starring this for now, but I have a feeling it will be bumped up to a 5 soon enough. Why? Only the finest in pho will get a 5-star rating from me and I have a lot more searching to do! Also, bleh to the service. Blehh.\\n\\nNote: the check-in offer of two egg rolls is not offered anymore :(	7	6	5

Service is pretty good. They take plates away and refill drinks a lot. \\n\\nFood is okay. There is a good selection of typical Chinese favorites like fried rice and wontons.

We also got the Sunset menu: wagyu beef ravioli, lobster pot pie, and candy bar dessert.  Foie gras is my absolute favorite, as always.  The textures and flavors of this particular dish were so satisfying and comforting.   As far as the lobster pot pie goes...True, cooking the lobster in a pot for 18-20 minutes may make it slightly rubbery, but lobster has that texture far more than any other crustacean anyway...the flavors are amazing.  Definitely a heavy dish, which is why I shared my husband\\'s and I just ordered a couple sides (which were great). You\\'re going to spend a lot of money there anyway...so the additional charge for the lobster pot pie was well worth it.  Cocktails are wonderful. \\n\\nSuperb food, service (LOVED our waiter), and ambiance.	0	0	0

Each dish was very salty and for the money it wasn\\'t worth it. Interior deco was very outdated.	0	0	0

So we were super thrilled when one opened inside Aria, which is usually the hotel we stay at.  I think when we visited, they just opened and we\\'re still working out a few kinks.  Plus, they didn\\'t have the lobster Baja....which I see on the menu now.  If they have it, it\\'s an absolute must!  Also ordered the wings which were amazing....the meat basically fell off the bone and was super flavorful.  Another must have is the whole fish ceviche (assuming you enjoy raw fish).  All in all, food is delicious.  Even though there is so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, this place will always be one of the stops when we visit.  As always, my opinion is just that.  Please visit and decide for yourself!	0	0	0

Their burgers are so delicious and flavorful and there are so many yummy toppings to choose from so you can make your ideal, personalized hamburger (avocado, bacon, cheddar, grilled onions on a pretzel bun... YUM!).\\n\\nI don\\'t get people who say it\\'s expensive compared to a place like In & Out- of COURSE it\\'s more expensive than In & Out. In & Out is a straight-up fast food hamburger. Smashburger is on the border between a fast food and a restaurant burger; the two cannot be fairly compared!\\n\\nI ate here a bunch of times when I lived in Illinois and since moving to Vegas, I\\'ve gotten to try the Sin City burger (with a couple of modifications) and it was delicious. OH and the Smashfries are awesome. Salty, but awesome.	1	0	0

Bingo! Blueberry Hill Family restaurant hit the spot. The place was packed but we were seated quickly. We had some families with wild, misbehaving children around, so that was not as desirable, but not the restaurants fault.  The place was clean, the service was prompt and friendly. Our food came out relatively fast and tasted yummy. Left there feeling full, and happy. Prices were reasonable. We enjoyed our meal and would go there again.  Oh, My husband had coffee and he thought it was really good!	0	0	0

He even came to our table to make sure our dining experience is expected. Service was exceptional! Quick and thorough, very knowledgeable waiters and servers, friendly and professional. Food wise, just delicious! Great choice of drinks to go with all the appetizers, caviar, truffles, steaks, fish, even dessert wine from 1987! Just spectacular! Will definitely go back. If you are in Las Vegas, with so many choices, Michael Mina is a must stop! Besides, it\\'s located inside of the Bellagio Garden, how perfect a restaurant can be :)!?	0	0	0

We had trouble with our rooms at the signature so we got $100 credit to try at any location belonging to the MGM. We decided on the MGM Grand Buffet. We were kind of iffy about it because of the reviews but we didn\\'t want the credit to go to waste. \\n\\nWe went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. We were informed about the unlimited mimosas which were very tasty. We were seated right away.\\n\\nWe thought the buffet was very clean compared to other buffets we\\'ve visited including the ones in our hometown. The person we got to pick up our plates was very friendly! He made sure everything was okay every time he stopped or passed by our table.\\n\\n\\nThe food was really good as well. They had all the breakfast food and some pasta, seafood! You name it ! The staff we interacted with were friendly. The only thing was that we were told one mimosa at a time per guest but saw they allowed other people take up to three at a time. We constantly had to get up for one. Still good though\\n\\nGood food and unlimited mimosas	1	0	1

The reason why it\\'s differnet is because they have white mayo sauce on top... which gives it a creamy flavorful taste. I enjoyed their sigsig very much, it was packed with flavor and creamy goodness.\\n\\nI also tried java rice for the first time. I did not enjoy it as much a garlic fried rice. I didnt get a chance to try their garlic fried rice.\\n\\nService was amazing. They constantly refill your water.	7	3	6

The ribeye steak was as good as it gets. The house special bacon-wrapped quail was cooked to perfection. But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy.\\nToo bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie. I have to say the service was uneven, like we were an afterthought once dessert was served.	0	0	0

It felt like an over-glorified Old Country Buffet except I would have chosen good ole OCB for my country hankering. Most of the food was stuff I could make myself and it just felt a bit more run-down and neglected than other places. If you\\'re going to spend the money on a buffet, consider elsewhere.	1	1	1

We are obsessed with this. You have to add some of their fresh crushed Garlic in the mix and you are in business. \\n\\nMAKE IT A COMBO....\\nsince you\\'ll have your seafood fix with the lobster ramen, add the Marinated Pork bowl and you\\'ll have your meat fix. \\n\\nEverything is really yummy.

I ordered the spinach salad which was very good fresh and delicious.  For my main course I ordered the bone in rib eye \\"house specialty\\"  it was great but it did not compare to the magic of my CUT ribeye.  This is an excellent restaurant the only flaw is its two minutes away from CUT!  It\\'s like playing basketball next to Jordan baseball next to Ruth.	0	0	0

One of the waitstaff tried to pick up our appetizer before we were finished (that\\'s a no no). The popovers were absolutely delicious!! They even give you the recipe for them! Everyone got a steak and at least one side and we ordered an onion ring for the table. This is when everything started to get messy. The waitress brought out wrong sides (at least our main dishes were right). Extra spinach, no Mac n cheese. When we told her to nix the onion rings she said \\"I was waiting for you to mention them, otherwise I was just going to take them off anyway.\\" Seriously, who does that? \\nAmbiance-4 stars\\nFood-4 stars\\nService-2 stars	0	0	0

The uni and scallops were plentiful sitting on top of rice and a bit of sweet sweet soy sauce. They also offer a large selection of specialty rolls, interesting sampler platters, and a 10-12 course set meal. The prices are very reasonable but you can get a great deal  if you pick a dinner combination or go during happy hour. Service was quick and efficient. It\\'s not an AYCE restaurant where you gobble down as much mediocre sushi as you can in 90 minutes. Stay, sit, and enjoy.	0	0	0

We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I\\'ve never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I\\'ve ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I\\'ve had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn\\'t care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn\\'t finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it\\'s worth every calorie that\\'s probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it\\'s amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge	0	0	0

I am yet to eat here since I\\'ve been back (I\\'ve definitely had my fill for a while), but I\\'m already looking forward to it.\\n\\nMaybe I just didn\\'t have the greatest experiences in Thailand, or maybe thai food in Thailand just is what it is. \\n\\nI will tell you though Le thai was one of the reasons why I was excited for thai food in Thailand, and yet nothing compared. \\n\\nThe Pad Se Ewu, Awesome Flat noodle, and Shrimp Stir Fry are among my favorite dishes here. \\n\\nIf you want to try something different and hearty, opt for the Tri Colored Shrimp Noodle Curry. Usually on the special board, but if not they can usually make it. It\\'s like the Thai version of Shrimp Alfredo! Without shrimp would be like Thai Vegan Alfredo!	0	0	0

Nothing to complain about here.\\n- Artichoke tortellini: this was very good as an appetizer.  Generous portions.\\n- Tuna tartare was nicely done with the quail egg mixed in\\n- Chilean sea bass was good, not great.  The  seared top was too salty, though the inside was nicely done and very buttery.\\n\\n\\nCan be better:\\n- Our main course food did take quite a while (~30 minutes after appetizers) to come out\\n- Salad appetizer was unappealing and a bit dry (lacking dressing/flavor)\\n- One of the salmon dishes was overcooked and we had to send it back.	0	0	0

Le Thai has a cool atmosphere & is not douchey. The wait for a table was over an hour, so  my friend & I sat at the side bar/stool area (and we didn\\'t have to wait at all). The atmosphere is a 4.5, and the food is a 3.5 or 4 (it was good but not great). I would definitely recommend coming here if you are in the downtown area.	0	0	0

It\\'s actually not that funny when you find some extra seasoning in your post hangover bowl of Pho.  \\n\\nMost of us ordered a few variations of the same entree, Pho.  My friend, who was about half way done with his bowl, discovered an extra little ingredient in his bowl.  A few of us kept eating because they were hungry, but I was pretty appalled because you know the soup is from the same Pot.  \\n\\nWe quickly notified the manager and he was truly apologetic.  I do think it\\'s an isolated incident but it needs to be noted because this pretty much ruined my appetite.  The manager comped us the entire meal.  \\n\\n2 stars....\\n\\n=======================================================\\n\\nI do have to say though, IF there was no roach in the pho, it would have tasted pretty fantastic.... almost Little Saigon Westminster fantastic, so take it for what it\\'s worth.	1	0	0

I had no wait time and the staff was really cool! \\nHint Hint, perfect place if you have the (munchies) ; ) Or even if you don\\'t. \\nThis place is far better than Wendy\\'s ,whomever said that must have an affiliation with that franchise as for myself, I will continue to frequent Burger Dogs because simply, it\\'s good.	0	0	0

It\\'s way too much,,,, but I guess if you are into healthy menu, you wouldn\\'t eat here. Buns are soaked with oil - you feel you are eating lard. It\\'s something that you shouldn\\'t eat everyday - not even once in a week...... if you don\\'t wanna get FAT.\\n\\nI liked fries OK. Unique stuff like fried pickles was OK. \\n\\nOnly good thing about this place is the price. They sell beer cheap. I think I paid only a buck or two for PBR.	1	0	0

A poor selection of dried out foods awaited us today. Very disappointed and disillusioned with this buffet. I do not recommend it. My father was able to slightly rectify the situation by making an egg salad sandwich from scratch. At least that wasn\\'t dry! It\\'s pretty sad when you have to prepare your own food in order to have something you like at a buffet! There\\'s a carving station but they only had turkey and some saugages (you guessed it - dry too).  I was told they were out of Tri-tip. I made myself a sandwich, something I never do at buffets. On the up-side, the desserts were good and I had lots of room!	0	1	0

It was when I was being seated at my table that I realized why the hostess offered me to take a look at the menu before I decide to dine there - I was the only one wearing a t-shirt and mini-skirt and flats. Then I got a little offended, thinking that the hostess probably thought I was a clueless international tourist from the Far East who randomly walked into the restaurant not knowing how fancy and pricey Michael Mina\\'s meals could go for. Anyway, long story short, I almost mistook my Dover Sole for Filet-O-Fish by Mr. McDonalds. The spoonful serving of corn soup that came before the meal was really good, but I can\\'t really recommend this place just for that. It\\'s funny how I enjoyed the Michael Mina in my town (XIV in LA) but not the one in Vegas. Are they sure they\\'re the same Michael Mina??? Just kidding.	2	1	0

Atmo isn\\'t bad... linoleum floor and cheap furniture, but with interesting ethnic touches... and besides, who cares when the food is so delicious and so cheap?!?  I had the vegetarian sampler for 2 with a side of beef tibs.... totally awesome and fantastic!  They have a full bar and it\\'s so cute to see the girls make drinks, since they probably don\\'t drink themselves and have no idea what\\'s in anything.  I had to tell the chick how to make a margarita (I was with my mom, cut me some slack) and she did a great job!  Anyhoo, this place is kinda in the ghetto, but don\\'t be a puss.  Live a little!!  Check it out!	1	1	0

I\\'ve given this place a couple of tries.\\n\\nSpicy beef ramen was very bland. No flavor and not even spicy. I actually ended up tossing it in the trash.\\n\\nCarne Asada fries were pretty good and because i liked the asada.. i tried the carne asada nachos. I barely touched it.. stick to the fries.\\n\\nI tried the carne asada burrito and eggroll today and i wasn\\'t impressed. The rice in the burrito really kills it but i guess you can order without it. The eggroll was so so.. nothing amazing. The side of veggies were very oily. \\n\\nMy friend had the steak quesadilla and jalapeño poppers and she liked it but you can\\'t really mess up a quesadilla. Overall.. i think I\\'m done going here. There\\'s a lot of other places that i know are better.	0	0	0

I winded and specifically asked what time you closed & I was told 11pm. I came back in at 10:15 to order and I was told that the Fryolator was already turned off for the night. So I altered my order and while I was waiting, the employee (she)  with attitude began to block the floor and put up the chairs at 10:20, working around me (which is very rude) and by 1030 the door was locked. I understand that they\\'re young and wanted a night out and leave before 11 but, none ever wants to be  treated unfairly & spoken to with an attitude. I tired calling serval times today 5-5-2017 to speak with the owner because of how offended I am by her behavior but, she refused to allow me to leave a message. Saying \\"you (meaning Me) can write an email or leave a compliant but, like I said, that\\'ll go through me too\\" --if she were working one of my restaurants. Shes be fired by now.	0	0	0

We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn\\'t always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn\\'t say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn\\'t feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn\\'t make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn\\'t need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn\\'t get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.	1	1	0

As other reviews note, tons of good food.  Prix-fix menu.  First course, shrimp scampi, was happily devoured by all.  The soup dish was the \\"ho-hum\\" course; nothing bad but not very interesting either.  The hummus / baba ganoush course was really high quality with bonus flourishes like olives and marinated carrots to take it up a notch.  Meat skewers were really tender, very above average.  Chicken cous-cous was a bit \\"ho-hum\\" for me but others in my family insisted it was amazing.  All this in a cozy setting (looks like you are in a tent) and multiple performances by some rather sexy belly dancers who I think did a good job keeping the female guests (e.g. my wife) feeling engaged and part of the fun.	0	0	0

Called from Planet Hollywood prior to ask how long the wait for 2 people would be, we were told currently it was an hour with no reservations available to make or give a name.  We made the trip over there, speak to the host and ask to put our name down for 2 people.  He gives us a look and a groan, so my response was \\"what, the wait is now up to 2 hours?\\"  His reply was \\"Actually it\\'s odd, I can seat you immediately right now.\\"  WHAT!  Score!  We were seated in literally 4 minutes.  This must have been a rare case, because we ended up being seated still in close proximity to the host platform and all the rest of parties of 2 coming in after us were all being told an hour wait and to take their name down.  I guess we were just lucky.\\nAll of the food was amazing, we had burgers and mac and cheese balls.  So good.  We ended up taking a few slices of cheesecake to go because he had a fridge in our hotel room.  The lemon meringue one was awesome!\\nWe had a great experience!	2	0	0

Our next order was Colorado lamb chops marinated and grilled, served with agria dulce (4 Forks) and crab paddies (3.5 Forks). We concluded the meal with a delicious crème brulee (4.5 Forks).	0	0	0

For $21 weekday dinner, it is such a good place to eat for the flavors, and the value. I enjoyed the prime rib and bone-in ham. I enjoyed the run raisin sauce, and the various desserts, specially the Bananas Foster. Darn, I forgot to get any of the hand-made crepes. I was just desserted-out. What I think could be improved is the seafood selection. The shrimp scampi was nothing special. But overall, the food, cost, and service is for me the current best value in Vegas.	1	0	1

Well the food was good. As for the service and the manners of the waiter that\\'s another story. After looking through the menu the waiter asked us \\"let\\'s do this\\"  \\nWe both asked for water with lemon, that he did bring us. Never once asking if there was anything else we need or even coming back to the table. Once he brought the food out didn\\'t ask if we needed anything else i.e. More napkins,water, etc. but he did a quick walk by and  blurted out water? I responded yes please, I had used the habanero sauce mouth was a little hot. Just then he ran out the front door to heckle some girls walking by the restaurant and even joked with another co worker about getting there phone numbers. Lunch was $22 and change. As we went to pay the cashier are server was standing by her side. We tipped him with cash and wow not even a thank you or hope you enjoyed your lunch or see you again. Absolutely nothing!! Strange thing about Vegas it\\'s built on service,service and more service and word of mouth. I blame management for poor training and lack of supervision. I already told are family how poor the service was. We have watched a half a dozen restaurants in that location come and go this will be no different. \\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time or money as there is a thousand restaurants to choose from and one on every corner in this town.	2	0	0

Pretty pricey on a Saturday night as well as busy but the line moved quickly... \\n\\nThe food was good, the highlight was the steak they make cooked to order with seasoning.. oh so good!  They have an omlette station too which is quite entertaining... Nothing else from the food section really stands out in my mind however... they had the usuals... salads, soups, pastas, and pizza...

Things like this little cup of tiramisu, mocha, or a little circle of cheesecake.  \\n\\nDefinitely not a let down... if you come hungry you\\'ll be satisfied!	2	2	2

Each protein he cooks has different veggies and sauce to accompany the meat and rice.  I had the mochiko chicken bowl and it was the best one I\\'ve ever had.  Nice crisp broccoli along with perfectly cooked rice.  The chicken had this great sauce that got really caramelized when fried up.  Finally have a good rice bowl spot in our part of town.	0	0	0

Yes very pricey but HUGE serving. All the sides were delicious as well; au gratin, broccoli, medley of mushrooms, popovers, asparagus. Really delicious. My friend had the lamb chops. This meal was so fulfilling, definitely bigger portions than expected so  next time sharing may be perfect. But absolutely delicious and great service and I just have to say, our buss boy was hot!	0	0	0

The flavors and ingredients just don\\'t belong together. I ordered the Acapulco with double salmon instead of tuna and just wasn\\'t happy. My burrito had more sauce and lettuce than anything else and It really overpowered the entire thing. \\n\\nThe three others in my group ordered bowls and were significantly disappointed as well. We hardly ate any of what we ordered and I ended up deconstructing my burrito to try and salvage some of the fish. We won\\'t come here again, but at least we tried.	0	0	0

We were seated in the farthest corner of the restaurant, there is a small room next to the main dining room, we were in there. It was peaceful, you\\'d never guess you were a couple hundred feet from the craziness in the Conservatory.\\n\\nWe were started with an amuse-bouche of watermelon topped with red onion, feta and balsamic vinegar. It was clean and refreshing.\\n\\nThen, we were offered breads: Italian and sourdough, both were warm and fresh. I preferred the Italian. After noshing on breads, we were brought our appetizers. My husband had bibb lettuce salad with Maytag Blue Cheese, Summer Corn, Bacon, Red Wine Vinaigrette. It was fresh and delicious, the vinaigrette was fantastic. I had the Heirloom Tomatoes Gazpacho with Spiced Crab Salad, Avocado, Summer Herbs. It was like biting into a fresh tomato only I was slurping it off a spoon. Yum. The crab salad was excellent, too.\\n\\nWhen it came to the entree I was torn, I planned to order the halibut which sounded fantastic, but the Lobster Pot Pie that Michael Mina is famous for was included on the Restaurant Week menu for a $30 supplement. Regular price for this dish is $78, this meant I\\'d get it plus a starter and dessert for $80.10. It sounds like a no brainer, but I\\'ve never been a fan of lobster. I tend to find the chewy texture off-putting, but on the other hand there was no better place for me to try it. My husband left it to the fate of eenie meenie miney mo and the winner was the lobster pot pie. I did not regret it. It was superb. I prefer the lobster claw to the rest of it, but overall it was very tasty. The brandied cream sauce was lush and velvety. It\\'s really a beautifully composed dish, I\\'m happy I experienced it. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a filet that was splendidly prepared it was one of the tastiest I\\'ve had in quite sometime, it was served with a short rib cottage pie, like shepards pie, with short rib, carmelized onions and whipped mashed potatoes. It was warm and comforting, not too mention delicious.\\n\\nBy some miracle we still had room for dessert. He had Michael\\'s Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Root Beer Sorbet, and Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies. The float was pretty good, but the cookies, oh! the sweet heavenly cookies were the star. They would\\'ve been perfect served with a glass of cold milk for dipping. I had the Summer Blackberries over Caramelized Brioche and Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream. Eh, it wasn\\'t very special. Neither the brioche or ice cream were a success. Thankfully, I have a dear husband who kindly shared his heavenly cookies.\\n\\nAfter dinner, the manager came by to check on us. We chatted a bit, mainly gushing how much we love Michael Mina\\'s restaurants. He returned and poured us each a glass of a nice dessert wine. I don\\'t recall what it was, but it was not cloyingly sweet like most dessert wines. We both really enjoyed it. Then, finally to end the meal our server delivered a plate of small treats with the check. The coconut macaroons and shortbread cookies were simply wonderful, as was the entire meal. The food, the service, it was all excellent. After three no-so=great meals, Michael Mina saved Restaurant Week.	4	0	2

They have an excellent selection of wine/beer/cocktails and very reasonably priced. Crab rangoons are some of the best I\\'ve ever had, perfect cream cheese/crab ratio. Shrimp Pad Thai was a little too heavy on the cilantro for our liking, it really overpowered the dish. There weren\\'t enough peanuts either. Also tried the Garlic Fried Rice with Tofu which was incredible. Spice level 2 was perfect for both of these dishes. Can\\'t wait to go back and try more items!	1	1	1

This species has an exquisite texture and \\"crunch\\" and unmistakeable flavor, when properly prepared. My \\"Maine Lobster Pot Pie\\" was fantastic! It was \\"to die for.\\" I prefaced that meal with an Artichoke Tortellini and my favorite single malt scotch, Glenfiddich. One of my group had the Phyllo-Crusted Sole, which was deemed excellent. The other member joined me in Heaven with their Maine Lobster Pot Pie.  Our total dining experience was excellent, and we loved the tasteful and subtle service of our waiter, Dennis. I would have come back for the same meal on another evening, but my party insisted that we go to different establishments during our stay at the Bellagio Hotel.	1	0	1

Alas, something has gone horribly wrong.  Rows and rows of empty shelves.  Diminished selection.  What happened??\\n\\nI used to stop by Polish Deli regularly.  Then, I got lazy, and ended up just going to Euro Delicacies because it was closer to my house.  In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that\\'s not saying much.\\n \\nYou can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven\\'t seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it\\'s like 90 degrees in the store).  I\\'ll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won\\'t.  Seriously depressing.	8	5	3

Vegas is a place of flashy exuberance; dripping with neon lights and bronzed blonds dressed in sequenced gowns. Champagne and caviar are as easily accessible as sweet Asian Lucy. Believe me when I say I wasn\\'t in the mood for either. After winning a whole ten bucks on the penny slots, I wanted something good and semi-cheap to celebrate.\\n\\nAfter meandering the pseudo streets of New York, New York, I settled on Jodi Maroni\\'s Sausage Kingdom. Surprisingly, this little stand had a lot to choose from. There are Sausage sandwiches available from Hot Italian to Polish and Bratwurst to Chicken Pomegranate. There\\'s also the good old fashioned hot dog which I settled on. I decided to get the combo which included fries and drink. The hot dog was good and the french fries were delicious. A simple meal, yes, but it definitely hit the spot AND I had some money left over from the ten bucks I won.\\n\\nJodi\\'s is located near the \\"Chrysler building\\" and the Zumanity entrance. There are a lot of little tables and chairs around to sit and enjoy your meal and it\\'s also a great area to people watch. Definitely a cute little  place. I give it three solid stars.	2	0	1

They have different kinds of bbq sauce but there was only one available for me to try. They were out of sweet tea when I got here, when I asked about it they brewed some more but didn\\'t add sugar the whole time I was there. I had the brisket sandwhich and mac n cheese, brisket was greasy and mac n cheese was bland. Will not come here again.	0	0	0

To start i really like the place, small enough to sit comfortably watch some filipino shows and really be in the feel of vegas. But what I don\\'t understand is how filipino food specifically restaurants have not raised to the top with our variety of taste and textures we should be at the top of the foodie charts.  When you serve your clients the basic staple of our country ( rice) please make sure its fresh. To serve me Garlic fried rice with the garlic purple in color this tells me that the rice has been sitting, re heated, re fried several times over that the garlic actually changes colors. This is a fact-\\n\\nRice to me is essential in this situation- Its really easy to cook and it can make or break you as a business. sounds funny, I know but to foodies like me its the details that matter. to some i might sound harsh or out pocket with my reviews. But like any consumer we want the best money can buy, in this case, basic filipino breakfast.\\n\\nperhaps next time I visit the experience will be different. but for now, until then. my ratings stand at 3 stars.	6	3	2

I\\'ve been twice and had really great Chicago style pizza and a huge fresh salad each time. The Chicago was really great. The crust and sauce were pretty much perfect. The complimentary bread sticks were soo good, too. My wife had fettuccine with alfredo and it was also some of the best I\\'ve ever had. Plus it was only $8!\\n\\nMy only complaint was about the house salad. Although huge and fresh, it only encompasses four ingredients. Romaine, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. We got the balsamic and ranch which were both freshly made and fantastic, but the salad could really use some more to it. Croutons and something else like that round it out would be nice. Plus the red onions were so hot and plentiful it tasted like a raw, red onion salad.\\n\\nService was great and prices were very reasonable, I will continue to go again and again.	2	0	0

The broth was flavorful and quite complex. I don\\'t have a very refined palate, but I enjoyed whatever it was I was sensing. The pork was different to what I\\'m used to. It had a stronger grilled flavor. So while nowhere near as tender as Monta, it was good in its own way.\\n\\nHonestly, I think I prefer Sora and Monta. But being so close to work, it\\'s an excellent lunch option. Their service was super quick and friendly too. That helps put Shoku into my work week lunch rotation.\\n\\np.s.

Usually the wait to be seated is the longest part of waiting at pho places, but we were seated and then waited a good 35 minutes before any of our orders started coming through. Other tables started getting their food before we did! To be fair, we did have a group of 8 and it was also EDC weekend , but that wait was ridiculous even for a busy weekend lunch. The actual pho was okay..nothing amazing or even remotely worth the wait. The service was terrible as well! Every time we asked for our food, we got rushed answers and rude tones. For a place so highly rated, I don\\'t believe that it accurately reflects the quality of this establishment at all. Never come here unless you want mediocre food that apparently takes nearly 40 minutes to be served.	0	0	0

I have tried most of the dishes and apps, and they range from solid to absolutely delicious. Start with the pork jerky - it is paired up with some rice and an excellent sauce. I have enjoyed every dish on the menu, but I will always favor the curry. The spicy eggplant is also dynamite. The decor is simple, but pleasant, with a small indoor room and a large outdoor area in the back. My only knocks are the service (commonplace for Asian restaurants) and the absence of wine glasses. Still, neither of those digs are enough to warrant anything other than the full five stars.	0	0	0

This place was wide open with only 5 other patrons in the building but the food was solid. Their chimichanga had slow roasted beef in it in a nice crispy fried tortilla. \\n\\nThe fiancé had a carne asada burrito that was not only big but a delightfully flavorful asada which plenty of spice and depth.

And they were also a little under cook. That is why I gave it a three star. Everything else was good especially for my first time. I heard this in and out is not so good but they do have different ones that are a lot better. I am yet to go try them out but I will let you guys know. Another thing I noticed is that the lines inside and the drive-through are always long. Burgers are a good decent size and will get you full. I had a strawberry milkshake and it was nice and thick.

I didn\\'t find the food \\"Wow\\" or \\"Yummy.\\" I was expecting a better buffet since this was inside MGM hotel. I would think the Rainforest Cafe tasted better. They don\\'t have much selection of food and is not like there is a chef behind each counter like at the Wynn. Luckily, we got reward points for this buffet, so we didn\\'t have to fork out much for it. We tasted the Alaskan crab legs, it was very salty (eeek!!) Umm, I would not come back.	0	0	0

They blow away IHOP, Denny\\'s or any other coffee shop I\\'ve ever been to for breakfast by a wide margin for breakfast.  I had an omelet, hash browns and pancakes which were really good and the coffee was excellent also.  The service was also as good as it gets.	0	0	0

I\\'ve been coming here every year as a birthday tradition since 2012. Can\\'t go wrong with Short Rib fried rice, spring rolls, and iced Thai tea! Everything on the menu is amazing and you can customize spice level depending on how you\\'re feeling. If you want more of an outdoor dining experience, they have an outdoor area with string lights, a wooden pallet roof, and some misters to keep you cool, but enjoy a meal outside. Thanks for existing, Le Thai!	1	1	1

Many good restaurants are.  Maybe it was the two people sharing a tiny \\"cigarette\\", out front, in broad daylight.  One of them looked like a cook.  They certainly seemed cheerful!\\n\\nThe inside was kind of dark, dingy and run down.  Come on.  Replace the burnt out bulbs!  I wanted authentic.  Gee, the flies were a nice touch.\\n\\nThere was some loud, obnoxious kid bothering the other customers.  Maybe it\\'s a cultural thing, but my young son wasn\\'t interested in making a new bestie today.\\n\\nThe sambusas were OK, but a bit overdone.  The crispy outside tasted a bit burnt.\\n\\nI had the vegetable platter.  I couldn\\'t tell if the individual sections were supposed to be warm or cold.  I don\\'t think they did either, since I kept getting warm and cold pockets within the same bite.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t a fan of the spongy bread.  It seemed like thin, cold pancakes.\\n\\nAnd I know it was just me, but I wasn\\'t a fan of the overall spices.  I much prefer Indian, anything Asian, Mediterranean, etc.  \\n\\nHalfway through my meal, they fired up some incense, a hookah or something.  The place filled up with smoke.  I couldn\\'t breathe, so I just paid up and left.\\n\\nMaybe if I try a different place, or order something different, I might like Ethiopian food at some point.  But for now, I think I\\'ll pass.	2	0	0

Unfortunately working in Downtown doesn\\'t give me much options in terms of food.\\n\\nI went to Le Thai once and ordered Awesome Flat Noodle with Shrimp. I really had high hopes because of the great reviews and the $15 price. \\n\\nThe portion was so so and the noodles were salty. I wanted to like it, but it was just not good enough and OVERPRICED.\\n\\n3 weeks later, i had my noodle craving and decided to try Le Thai again. I ordered over the phone for take out. The food was ready when I get there and the server was friendly and sweet. \\n\\n(So, my rating is solely based on their food.)\\n\\nI ordered Pad Kee Mow (chicken option, $13) this time. Again, the noodles were so SALTY! I thought my taste buds were too sensitive, so I asked my husband to try the noodles. He thought the noodles were too salty too. The ingredients were nothing to write home about; minced chicken with some veggies. I was so disappointed. If this wasn\\'t a take out, I would have returned it and gave my comment to the chef. \\n\\nMy husband\\'s Lunch Special Green Curry was ok. But I had such bad experience with their noodles that I just won\\'t go back.  Sorry, it\\'s you. Hopefully you can improve your noodle dishes soon.	5	0	0

Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that?\\n\\nThings got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well. \\n\\nOverall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown.	1	0	0

We had the rajah masala (MUST TRY) and it was absolutely stellar: cold spicy marinated peanuts with homemade chips. Super duper flavorful and really unique. We also had the Asian persuasion burger - I wasn\\'t a fan of the sesame seed bun but my boyfriend loved it - and the Indian chop suey, which was essentially noodles fried crispy-hard with sautéed veggies and it was very, very spicy but still flavorful. If this wasn\\'t so far for us I would definitely come back to try other dishes. Honestly the only reason I\\'m giving them 4 stars is the location. I\\'m no stranger to a good dive bar but this bar is honestly just outdated and a bit boring. Wish there was a little more unique atmosphere and drinks to match the truly unique food.	1	1	2

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it\\'s not as convenient to get to.\\n\\n$17.99 for champagne Sunday Brunch (without player\\'s card) and they did not mess around with the champagne. They basically just poured the entire contents of the bottle into our drink glasses (and it was just two of us). The servers were very attentive and fun. \\n\\nThe buffet itself: heaven\\n\\nMade to order omelet station-delicious with plenty of options.\\n\\nSeafood! Delicious baked clams, sushi, lox for bagels, calamari, and plenty if other options I did not even try (including crawfish which I thought I would try but instead became our table mascot).\\n\\nPlenty of fresh fruit and cereals including oatmeal and grits. \\n\\nThe rotisserie chicken melted in my mouth and had I not filled up on everything, else the honey glazed ham looked amazing. \\n\\nDessert selection: wow. So many cookies, pastries, pies, and cakes to choose from, but I had to have the chocolate fountain. \\n\\nIf I could have stayed for more time (and had a bigger stomach), I think I would have tried everything in the Mexican and Italian sections because everything looked delicious. \\n\\nKeep in mind that I have never been to another Buffet in Vegas, so perhaps there are better ones out there, however I know where I am going the next time I am in Vegas.	1	0	3

What really stood out to me was the pork that came with it was crispy - yum! good in flavor and didn\\'t break apart like normal pork in ramen. \\n\\nThe ramen was ok/not bad in the beginning but over time it had a strange taste or not something I\\'m used to - not sure if it was the green leaves something or the shredded red thingies in it either. the portion is average, didn\\'t really fill me up either.\\n\\nThe menu is a little bit pricey overall and are actually part of Bachi Burger too - when I went it was a bit confusing because the door was under construction..so you had to enter through Bachi Burger\\'s entrance and state where you wanted to eat and then they\\'d guide you to a table. \\n\\nIt\\'s a maybe if I\\'ll be back. \\n\\nOh they take Discover cc too, so I guess that\\'s a plus.	2	1	0

Probably some of the best fried spring rolls I\\'ve had. We asked the waiter what the most popular appetizer was, and he promptly replied, \\"We have the best egg rolls in town!\\" He didn\\'t lie.\\n\\nI had the beef stew with french bread - really nice portions and presentation, and the bread was perfect, having the nice consistency with soft, semi-chewy inside and thin crispy outside (but not super flaky). Not even the slightest hint of stale-ness in the bread like most places give you. I\\'ve grown up with great tasting Vietnamese food all my life and both of my parents are chefs - and this place did not disappoint. That\\'s saying a lot! :)\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the combination pho - nothing to complain about and everything to praise. I seriously can\\'t find any faults with this place. The place was very clean and well stocked with condiments. The service was quick and friendly. \\n\\nIf I lived here in Vegas, this place would definitely be a frequent spot to eat for me. With flavors and prices spot on, I\\'d recommend this place to anyone craving and looking to try Vietnamese cuisine.	0	0	0

But my review is based off my most recent visit which was Sunday night \\n\\nWe got there with a complete group of 8 and granted it was a busy night for them. But there were still tables vacant. We stood at the front of the door way for about 15-20mins before I got frustrated enough to go up to someone and ask when would we be seated. There also was another group of 4 waiting to be seated. \\n\\nI\\'m not trying to sound like there was a cultural preference... But while still waiting to be seated... Another group of 7 arrived (Chinese) and started talking to someone in Chinese about getting seated I\\'m assuming and they started to walk them to a table BEFORE SEATING US!!!  So I said EXCUSE ME!! And put a stop to that quick. \\n\\nSo finally after getting seated... It was about 20minutes before anyone came to take our order. Again granted it was busy... But that should be no excuse. And remember that 7 person group that was Chinese trying to skip us... They ordered before us... And their food came out before anyone even came to get our order!! \\n\\nI HAD TO GO UP AND GET SOMEONE AGAIN to come to our table, take our food and drink order. They didn\\'t even get our drink order... They had only served us hot tea. I was LIVID. We kept seeing others people food come out before ours and my patience was running thin. \\n\\nI promise you it was almost 45 before we GOT UP AND LEFT!! We were able to get two sodas and they were asking US TO PAY FOR THE SODA! And I had to tell them that is BS and it should be on the house!! We even ordered soup- THAT COULDA BEEN THE FIRST THING TO COME OUT!!! But NOTHING!! For 45mins!! Bad form and unacceptable! \\n\\nMy parents were livid and my mother even started a mild fight with the manager on the absolute HORRIFIC service we received!! \\n\\nThe first time we went we brought them big business!! 33 people!! And the food was actually good and decent. And obviously our food didn\\'t come all out at the same time but one at a time. - that\\'s how it shoulda been on Sunday! They coulda given us the dam soup first at least \\n\\nI PROMISE YOU we are NEVER going back to this establishment	5	0	0

Not thrill with flavour like I expect.  The broth is slightly saltier than it should. This may be due to  my reduce salt in take.  My son had beef stew egg noodle. That was way too salty.

The waffle fries were also very good but you have to pay for them separately (they don\\'t come with the burgers). It\\'s a good hang out place, as they have games to play around the restaurant.

There is a Michael Mina in SF which I hear is better than the one in Vegas yet the one weekend I\\'m in Vegas, I decided to go to Michael Mina instead of trying somewhere new! =T\\n\\nIn any case, the bf and I went. We decided to try one of his Signature Trios so, we went with the classic pork. The pork is prepared in three ways; 1.kurobuta 2.pork belly with marmalade 3. BBQ pork worchestershire. The presenation was nice, however, the taste was not. Kurobuta is naturally fatty and tender. I have never met a dish of kurobuta that I could not finish. Mina certainly changed that for me. It was chewy and extremely tough. It\\'s a shame. 2 & 3 arent even worth mentioning. We couldnt finished our trio. Such a waste.\\n \\nOn a more positive note, the following dishes were memorable:\\n1. the butter poached lobster. the foam was a nice touch, it added a bit of lightness to the dish.\\n2.the lobster pot pie. Thin on the dough and cream - its a good thing. it allows the lobster to stand out and not be overshadowed by the sides.\\n3.Foie gras medallion over the american styled kobe. Foie gras was sweet and the meat was juicy.\\n\\nIs it me or is Mina becoming a little too commercial and completely over rated? Not worth the pricetag...dont fall into the hype.	4	4	5

This would be a great place to go for a casual date, I think. They have a fairly small menu with few vegetable options so I opted for the the tofu and basil dish and Max had the beef curry.

Chef Tony, who has experience as an executive chef in both NY and LV, is hustling and bustling in his new Westside venture. I was turned on to this place by a friend at my gym who said she heard a lot of people raving about a rice bowl place on Durango. The rumors were true - this place delivers on tastiness and freshness! My husband and I shared the pork belly rice bowl and the fish (aka KFC rice bowl).  We both preferred the fish, but I liked being able to share two different meats. We\\'re going to go for the chicken and beef next, since I\\'m sadly allergic to shrimp. The bowls came with perfectly cooked rice - the kind of perfectly cooked, fluffy rice judges expect from chefs on cooking competitions, but very few people actually execute successfully. It\\'s the kind of rice my mom makes in her expensive Tiger rice cooker, but I can\\'t replicate in my admittedly crappy Costco rice cooker. I stress the rice perfection because of the couple of (misguided) reviews who have a problem with the rice --- this is steamed rice, not fried rice. Fried rice is best made from day old rice that is separated in a wok. This space used to belong to Angel\\'s Fried Rice, so a few of their former patrons seem to be taking out their longing for fried rice on this place. \\n\\nWe also split the pho-king egg, which was my favorite item we ordered. I\\'m not a pho person, so for me, this dish reminds me of the best quality Filpino arroz caldo you can imagine with a yummy and yolky egg on top. We also ordered the side salad, which came with 3 generous portions of homemade dressings - wasabi ranch, creamy miso/sesame, and chinese black vinaigrette. My husband loved the wasabi ranch, where I liked the vinaigrette the most. We didn\\'t even bother using a fork, we just grabbed the veggies by the handful and dipped them in the dressing. The vegetables in our salad, and in our rice bowls, were very fresh and paired well with the rest of the food. One of the many reasons I was so excited about this place was it gave me another healthy option to dine out at. Yes, I know, their meat is fried, but you can load up on delicious veggies here and actually enjoy it!\\n\\nTLDR? Come here for a quick lunch or dinner option, where you don\\'t have to sacrifice freshness or flavor to enjoy. \\n\\nOnly con about this place? Chef Tony is a Cavs fan, but we won\\'t hold that against him ;P. I\\'m hoping this place thrives in 2016!\\n\\nEDIT - Updated this from 4 to 5 stars because my husband would sneak off here on his own because the dishes were so tasty! I had his leftovers and everything was still amazing the next day!	8	7	9

I had the chicken teriyaki, which came with a sad little iceberg lettuce salad and some glycerined pseudo-Italian-like dressing in a tiny plastic cup.  I was underwhelmed by the flavor of the chicken. The taste improved after I added what I assume is more teriyaki sauce (from another plastic cup) but still, so little flavor!  I won\\'t be back.  An acquaintance of mine loves this place, though- says it\\'s won the Best of Las Vegas award more than once.   Honestly, it seems any place can win that award.	1	0	1

I picked this place based on their ratings initially.  Well, they did not fail -- the food is SO good!  Pretty sure one of my co-workers was almost crying she was so happy.  It\\'s off the main strip, but totally worth it.  Not to mention, we had ordered a 10 course meal (split between two people each) for about $20-$30.  We barely even finished it, but powered through because everything was so delicious!  Wait staff and chefs were very friendly and attentive.  Definitely going back when in Vegas again :)	0	0	0

Steak was ok, needed more flavor in my opinion.  So happy to see foie gras on their menu but it was just ok - I\\'ve had better.  The scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  Everything else was ok.  Great service.	0	0	0

Ramen was good - flavor was there, but I will say that I\\'m a little disappointed with the portion. I felt a little skimped out on the broth. Now these bowls can be a little tricky since they look deep, but since I ordered extra chasu  it really seemed like there wasn\\'t enough broth left in the bowl for me to enjoy . \\n\\nAs far as service goes, it was very average. You guys just opened - please seem motivated and happy that you have customers coming in for lunch! Will I come back? Sure, there\\'s plenty on the menu I would love to try. Hope you take this and improve in the next coming weeks!	5	1	3

Also give your staff a raise for the great customer they provided for those who worked the lunch buffet on Tuesday 2/28/17. Or at least show them his message.	3	1	1

We come here almost everytime we are in Vegas because it is such a great deal and has very quick service! They have $2 tacos and $2 margaritas!! This is probably the best deal on the strip!! You can choose from shredded beef or shredded chicken and they come with cheese, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes and sour cream. The margaritas are pretty big, probably the size of a solo cup, definitely worth the $2. They also have a queso fundido dip that is EXCELLENT!!\\n\\nPROS: The $2 deal is the best! There is a 2nd deal for $14 that is 3 tacos and an order of nachos. The nachos are insane!! The plate is overflowing and is probably enough for 4 people to eat off of! Great deal!\\n\\nCONS: This is not a glamorous place by any means, its a simple little restaurant no bright lights or anything like that. If your looking for a place to be seen and get dressed up this is not your joint. \\n\\nTIPS: If you are in Vegas without a Total Rewards card your crazy! Everywhere you go (that is a Total Rewards owned property) you can earn comps with it and most places give you a discount as well. It\\'s free to sign up so why not. The tequila bar is another place that offers you a discount if you have a total rewards card so be sure you bring it!	2	0	0

The restaurant itself looked very nice. Open kitchen where you can see the chef prepare your meal. They decorated the place with noodle bowls which added a nice touch. Now moving on to the food... We ordered spicy beef brisket noodle and tonkatsu ramen.  At a noodle house the broth makes or breaks the soup. The broth of the tonkatsu ramen was bland. We had to add soy sauce and other spices to make it decent. It certainly was not a $12 ramen. The spicy beef noodle was alright although the choice of using udon for this type of soup was off. In the span of time that we were having lunch three customers complained about their food. One soup got sent back because it was served lukewarm. A couple ordered fried egg rolls and they sent back the lettuce that they serve it with as it was dirty! And we complained about the lack of flavor of the soup which the chef just shrugged off saying it tastes fine to him! Needless to say, we are never going back.	3	1	1

All of the FOH staff were very friendly and kind and the bussers were always making sure no empty plates lingered. \\n\\nAs mentioned above, I went there two days in a row and all of the options were exactly the same. It felt a little repetitive and might have been nice if there was more of a different variety the next day. Nonetheless, the food was very yummy!	0	0	0

I understand that the location has now merged with Shoku Ramen-ya and the servers might not have adjusted to the ramen menu or may not be as knowledgable about it. I myself am not a true ramen connoisseur, but I know what I like and what to order. My friend and I both ordered a bowl of ramen; I ordered tantanmen and my friend ordered the spicy miso ramen. Our waitress Annette put in our orders. About 15 minutes later another waitress dropped off our ramen, rushingly saying \\"who had the tantanmen\\". I slightly raised my hand and she placed the bowl in front of me. She then assumed my friends bowl was in her hand and rushingly said \\"this is tonkatsu\\" and rushed away from our table. My friend asked what she said and I thought I misheard her but I knew tonkatsu did not sound anything like spicy miso. We knew, however, that it was not her bowl because it contained egg, broth that did not look spicy at all, and other ingredients that were not supposed to be in the spicy miso ramen. We then asked a male waiter who told us what they were but he was quickly brushed off by our waitress Annette who said \\"oh these bowls are correct but you guys just have each other\\'s bowls\\". She then switched our bowls and left us confused. I then went on yelp to look at the pictures of the ramen dishes we ordered while my friend dived into the dish in front of her. I found a pic of my dish which was now the dish with the egg and unknown ingredients, it looked nothing like the tantanmen dishes that people posted pictures of. We then called the waitress Annette over and she said \\"these bowls are correct, this is what you ordered\\" so we asked for a menu and she showed us on the menu what we ordered. Our ingredients did not match the ingredients on the menu! But she insisted they did and we said the spicy miso isn\\'t even spicy. \\"She then said it\\'s not supposed to be very spicy. Then we asked why does it have extra ingredients in it. So she said well the chefs must\\'ve just added extra products and that it would only cost US a couple more dollars, as she laughed it off. At this point she started blaming us for the switch and tried to give me back the tantanmen that my friend, who was starving, had already eaten quite a bit out of. She kept saying \\"well you guys were confused but it is correct so you can switch up the bowls again, this is in fact what you ordered\\". We KNEW what we ordered and this was not it. We asked to speak to a manager. The manager came to our table and said \\"so I heard that there was a mix up between you two but it is now resolved\\". We told her it was not resolved and we explained to her what happened. She then suggested that her waitress and staff were correct and that we should just switch the bowls back. She then lifted the bowl that my friend had been eating out of and tried giving it back to me. How unprofessional to assume that I want to eat out of a bowl that\\'s already been eaten out of and pay full price for it. I stopped her before she placed it down in front of me and we asked for different bowls. She then said \\"let me talk to my cooks and see if there was in fact a mix up\\". She finally came back to our table and said \\"oh, there was a mix up actually because another table ordered almost the same ramen as you, and you two got their orders\\" she then agreed to give us new ramen bowls. Then our waitress came back and said \\"I am sorry that you were confused and I will take off one of the ramens for you, is there anything else I can get for you?\\" We said no, we just want our ramen so that\\'s it. They brought us the correct ramen and the check. The check did not comp us like Annette said it would. I then asked what happened to the comped bowl and she said \\"oh no actually you are going to be paying full price for what YOU ordered\\". We were then so frustrated that we paid and left. I am very disappointed in the service and especially with Annette and the manager! They blamed us for their mistakes and it is not acceptable	2	2	0

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\\n\\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \\n\\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\\n\\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\\n\\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \\n\\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there\\'ll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.	12	6	6

Recently those two restaurants by the same owner merged the entrance - now Shoku shares the entrance of Bachi Burger.	7	4	5

The lobster pot pie here is one of my favorite dishes out of everything I\\'ve tried in the world, and it rightfully occupies that \\"My Last Meal on Earth\\" blurb in my Yelp profile. A 2.25 lb Maine lobster, perfectly cooked inside a pot pie with mushrooms and mixed vegetables in the most decadent sherry sauce I\\'ve ever had? Ugh. This is what I work out at the gym so much for, just so I can have it a few times a year.\\n\\nThere are two other must-haves: the ahi tuna tartare, which is served tableside mixed up with pine nuts and quail eggs, alongside brioche; and the caviar parfait - caviar on top of a mix of salmon and chives and creme fraiche, all over a lightly-fried potato shallot cake (which is the best \\"hash brown\\" I\\'ve ever had... and I love my hash browns).\\n\\nThis review is not without negatives; I am definitely not a fan of this place going downmarket over the years. For example, today\\'s chilled seafood platter is but a shadow of what it once was (don\\'t bother with it). Many of the higher-end selections (such as in their steaks) are long gone. Also, why get rid of the famous Michael Mina tasting trios?\\n\\nHowever, the service has not suffered any sign of going downmarket. The servers are as attentive as ever without being at all overbearing or pretentious. The master sommelier here (Joe) is an awesome person to just chat with about wines. I love bouncing all my random wine thoughts off him, and he\\'s really nice to humor me.\\n\\nAnd the bottom line is this: to have a meal consist of the caviar parfait, tuna tartare, lobster pot pie, and root beer float to finish comes very close to what I would consider a perfect meal. And to have every course be from the same restaurant? How could I not give this place 5*?	3	0	2

So I went to the closest food place which happened to be this Carl\\'s Jr/ Green Burrito. Anyway, I go into the restaurant and their only like 3-4 people in the restaurant, and they all just look \\"shady\\". But when \\"nature calls\\" you try to look past that. So, I go to the restrooms, and the entire restroom is empty, and I handled my buisness. I heard someone come in, and I opened the door to go wash my hands, and I swear there was a kid who looked 6 or 7 years old, and she turned around and looked right at me and she looked normal except she had an eyepatch that looked like it was made out of metal. I thought I was in \\"Children of the Korn\\". Anyway, this review is not about the food, and I will never eat at this Carl\\'s Jr, because of this experience.	0	7	1

We wanted pho, and Kinh Do was the closest place in the Old Vegas area.\\n\\n-- VENUE --\\nThe place looks like most Vietnamese pho restaurants: lots of tables, Asian portraits on the wall, lucky bamboo decorating the restaurant, with a clean bathroom. Typical expectations.\\n\\n-- PHO --\\nI\\'ve eaten pho most of my life and can tell what\\'s good and bad at this point. If they get the base broth right, there\\'s hardly a need to add additional sauces and enhancements to it. The pho here had a good base, and I barely added any other sauces to it. I ordered a large and ate every noodle.\\n\\n-- SUMMARY --\\nI give the pho four stars. The service was sufficient; the staff was friendly enough and they refilled water as necessary. It was a nice casual night out with tasty pho and spending quality time with my family away from home. Recommended.	0	0	0

The service was somewhat disappointing as we had to ask our server for the pre-theater menu that they promote outside and on the website.  The other servers were promoting this menu, but not ours - I guess because it was cheaper than the other prix fixe menu being offered.	0	0	0

The place is clean and the service is good but the selection and quality of food needs improvement.  I wasn\\'t the only person walking around with empty plates looking for something to fill it with.  Maybe there wasn\\'t much food because it was lunch.  Perhaps their dinner selection is better but I don\\'t think I\\'ll return to this buffet.\\n\\nNot worth the money.	3	1	2

If you are not a local, it is not more than a twenty minute ride from the strip and it will give you more of an affordable/local selection on beer.\\n\\nAces and Ales has over 20 taps that constantly change throughout the year. Some of the local taps they may have on include selections from Big Dog\\'s Brewing Company, Tenaya Creek Brewery, Joseph James Brewery, and Chicago Brewing Company. Outside of that, they tend to have fantastic selections of some of the nation\\'s best craft breweries such as: Epic (UT), Stone (CA), Deschuttes (OR), Lagunitas (CA), New Beligum (CO) and much more!\\n\\nThe food selection is amazing for bar food. They have some of the best bar pizza in town and some interesting creations such as the Eddie Spaghetti Pizza or the Metallica Meat Lovers. The Mac and Cheese menu is very good as well with many different selections to choose from. Every Tuesday each week is a special event known as Tuesday Night Tastings. In this event, the chefs at Aces and Ales create an appetizer or dinner item that comes with 6 4oz tastings of beer for $20. Some of the most recent TNT offerings included a Krispy Kreme Burger, Lobster and Crab Bisque, and Baked Oysters.\\n\\nAces and Ales also has some very big beer events! Every first Friday of the month is SNAFU---Southern Nevada Ales and Fermenters Union. This is a homebrew club that meets at Aces and Ales and partakes in sharing their brews and stories with each other. Every Sunday is Black Market Crash where all beers are $4 and there are half-price Growler fills. Aces is also known for its festivals including Stone Domination Tap Takeover Weekend, Strong Beer Fest, and Winter Beer Fest. On many occasions as well they will have brewery take overs (most recently as of 3/19/2013 by Epic Brewing Company and one by New Belgium) \\n\\nThe ladies and men that work here are some of the most friendliest staff you will find in Las Vegas. They will gladly talk beer with you and as well give you recommendations based off your own personal preferences. \\n\\n\\nOver 20 taps always pouring great beers! Outside that, the staff is super friendly! Bar food is killer....go for the Belgian Frites or fried cheese curds. This is by far the best beer bar in town. They have multiple events each year like Winterfest or Strong Beerfest that make for a good all around time	3	1	4

I was excited to get the chance to on my latest trip to Las Vegas and I was not disappointed!  We went for lunch on a Tuesday and did not have a wait to get seated (yay!).  The prices of items on the menu were surprisingly very reasonable.  The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had a buffalo burger and fries.  He said it tasted great and was very filling.  I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I was very pleased with it; tasted fresh and delicious.  For desert we shared the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  Holy. Cow. It was so good.

In the past I have always made my visits to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered their \\"chicken picata entree\\" which was awesome, it consisted of lemon flavored chicken (mixed/ cooked with other high quality ingredients) and angel hair pasta. The majority of their menu is outstanding to choose from however it matters most of what you are in the mood for or ask the server to give you the best ideal selections. The customer service is stellar as well as the prices (not too steep). For the service and the food quality this place usually tops/ does better than the other 5 star rating restaurants within the Vegas strip and you wont over spend your money. The location is inside the Caesar\\'s palace mall (forum shops) nearby the aquarium. Again they usually do a great job getting you situated upon arrival however I usually visit them during the middle of the week.	0	0	0

Chipotle started near the campus of the University of Denver. At one time McDonald\\'s had stock in the company, but a couple years ago the owner of Chipotle bought back that stock. The owner is a proponent of healthy food, and even sponsored showings of Food, Inc. I can appreciate that.\\n\\nMy typical order is a veggie burrito with rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn salsa, pico and lettuce. I\\'ve never had a bad experience with any of these ingredients. I could probably eat this a few times a week, but I am glad I don\\'t have to. \\n\\nI think that the staff at this Chipotle are probably the nicest and the quickest that I\\'ve experienced. This is probably due  to the location near UNLV. On my last visit last week, each person working at the restaurant acknowledged me and said \\"hi\\". It was pretty busy as it was dinner time, so that was really surprising. \\n\\nAn added bonus about this location is that if you show your UNLV Rebel Card you get a free soda.	1	0	0

Their normal size is like the size of a large anywhere else and they have an even bigger size if you prefer for $1 extra. I\\'ve only been here twice and they were very different experiences. My first visit was a weekday afternoon and I ordered the #1, the large House Milk Tea with Boba and Pudding (~$6). This visit was great, our group hung out for hours playing a card game they had lying around called Flip City. My drink was great, lasted a long time because I got a large, though next time I might as for it less sweet. There was a steady stream of customers but the place wasn\\'t packed and the atmosphere was chill.\\n\\nOn my second visit, I came on a Saturday night and witnessed the popularity of this place firsthand. Every table was taken, the line was to the door, and people were loudly playing card games. Alright, so I decided to just get something to take home. This time I ordered another thing on the top 10, a large Okinawa Coffee + Sea Salt Latte (~$6.50) and asked for it less sweet. The lady at the register was nice and she asked me to try it and make sure it was okay. The drink was ridiculously sweet and I asked her if they could make it even less sweet. Someone took it to the back but I saw them just add plain water into the drink and mix it up... (water? why not just add more of the coffee?) Sure enough, when I was asked to try it again it tasted like watered down coffee. I gave up. I waited long enough in line and the place was so packed that I didn\\'t want to stay there any longer. Really disappointing as the drinks are fairly expensive compared to other boba shops.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: I\\'ve noticed a lot of uncanny similarities between this place and a chain of boba places in LA called Half and Half. From their paper menu design, to their top ten layout and large boba cups, its all eerily similar and I\\'m curious if they\\'re affiliated. I had one good experience and one bad experience thus far. I like their location but I\\'ll definitely avoid busy days and times here. I still think Brew Tea Bar is the best boba place in town but Tea Space is a decent alternative if you\\'re near Chinatown.	1	1	1

They are just bites, so order one order for each person. \\n\\nWe moved on to the dungeoness crab ravioli, foie gras risotto (seeing a trend here) and tuna tartare, all of which were well balanced and very flavorful. We requested a wine pairing with our various dishes, but did not want to drink full glasses. Our server suggested half pours (they were actually more generous than that), which we appreciated and were expertly selected.\\nThe only reason we did not give this establishment 5 stars is we felt the entrees were a bit overpriced.

Strange name, but they were pretty decent for fast food. Years later, I read Morgan Spurlock\\'s book, he\\'s known for doing Supersize me. In Don\\'t Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl\\'s as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired? \\n\\nThere is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl\\'s. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path. So I veered left and slammed into that island in front of the Carl\\'s. \\n\\nalso, in the area was the first (ghetto) apartment I had when I moved to Vegas, so I have been going to this location since moving here in 1999. The Ghetto apartment has since been refurbished somewhat as a Siegel Suite.\\n\\nCarl\\'s is one of maybe 3 national chains I go to for one reason: The Big Carl. Right up against McDonald\\'s mystery mad cow beef, the Big Carl is a larger burger for cheaper. Folks, there is NO reason to go to McDonald\\'s since the McD brothers sold to Krok.  They put unsanitary barfed and peed on playgrounds and make happy little sweatshop imported toys so that your kids will nag you to go. \\n\\nSo go to Carl\\'s!	2	3	4

I discovered this place years ago on one of the many business  trips I make to Vegas every year.  A friend and I were hungry, and looking for a place to eat near by our hotel.  We just looked for restaurants in his cars GPS, and to my surprise there was an Ethiopian place near by!   I often eat at one of the many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in Los Angeles, but had never seen one in Vegas.... Until that faithful day.\\n\\nIf you like hole in the wall type places that offer excellent ethnic food, this place will not disappoint.  I\\'ve eaten here about 8 times now, and have yet to have a bad meal.  All of the Ethiopian staples are here.   The injera (a type of sour spongy flat bread) is perfectly prepared with just the right bite, and a fluffy yet chewy texture.   The tibs and wat (beef or lamb) are both beautifully spiced and  prepared.  The Doro wat (chicken stew with egg) is also excellent.  The little salad that is served with all meals has a nice dressing, and a little tomato for added sweetness.   All of the vegetarian options are available as well, and are just as good.\\n\\nToday I had the pleasure of sampling their Ethiopian coffee!  Perfect.  Strong and sweet, with no milk.   They prepare it in a special kettle by hand on a small range / open fire right in the middle of the restaurant.   (not in the back kitchen)  I hadn\\'t planned on ordering it, and I wasn\\'t even quite sure what it was the lady was preparing at first.  It looked interesting, as it is appeared to be quite an involved process.  I asked what she was preparing, and she was happy to explain to me that she was making coffee, and was kind enough to offer me a cup.   It was so good!   I\\'m a fan of Cuban coffee, but this gives it a run for it\\'s money.  At the end of the meal, I wasn\\'t even charged for it.\\n\\nThe Portions are huge, and the prices are very reasonable.  A meal with soda clocks in at about 10 bucks with tax, and you\\'ll probably have some left overs.  The service has always been friendly, and prompt.   It\\'s a really special place, that definitely caters to the local Ethiopian population.   You\\'ll often see local cab drivers on their breaks eating a quick bite, or Ethiopian ladies gossiping or discussing the days news over coffee.  It\\'s a very authentic experience, which is often hard to find in Las Vegas.   Don\\'t let the neighborhood or exterior scare you away, an excellent experience awaits you inside!	4	0	1

Variety of foods to choose from, so go eat it. If you are in vegas, you definitely need to have at least one buffet. I would recommend trying this one out, as they have tons of options, and very good service.	0	0	0

We went twice during our stay for the crepes. The best by far was the one with nutella and banana. The fruit ones were a little too sweet.	0	0	0

The chairs are not comfortable and it just isn\\'t very inviting. Our meal was excellent! We had bone-in NY and bone-in ribeye. The truffle potato chips are a must. Our wait staff was very good too..professional and helpful. Again, not impressed with the atmosphere. It has a big dining hall feel. Emeril often makes gluten free modifications but there aren\\'t any here.	0	0	0

It was a family trip so we had my baby nephew with us, and instead of them turning their noses r rolling their eyes at the matter,  they were so accommodating.  We usually wouldn\\'t  think about bringing a baby to fine dining, but since this was a vacation, we couldn\\'t put him with the bell boy. =) So needless to say, the whole time they made us feel comfortable and very welcome. So that fact alone really impressed us.  \\n\\nOur waiter was attentive and detail about the menu and had great recommendations,  but of course being me, I\\'ve already had my mind set on something.....And Two words...LOBSTER POTPIE! It was a great big portion and was so yummy and rich, I was happy and full for the rest of the night. the best part of it was the flaky, buttery and crisp crust...mmmmm, so good! But I also enjoyed the steak tar tare! Fresh, soft and melted in my mouth! It was delish! \\n\\nSo overall I had a great experience and would definitely come back =)\\n\\nOh! and my MUST recommendation is to bring a sweater!! THE AC inside was on so high, i had the sniffles after i left there, haha....	0	0	0

It was honestly the first place we saw in the forum shops which didn\\'t make either one of us go \\"meh\\". \\n\\nI didn\\'t feel like a burger so settled on a spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It really didn\\'t have a spice to it but it didn\\'t taste too bad. The service was excellent, however. I go thru a ton of pop refills, especially when I\\'m out walking and wandering, and the server was on it. \\n\\nThere wasn\\'t a wait to get seated, but they made us go upstairs - wait, there\\'s a 2nd floor to a restaurant on the forums, it must have an awesome view! - nah, don\\'t get too excited. It\\'s a small, enclosed space with the only view being that of the other tables. The middle is cut out so you can look down on the bar, but that\\'s about it.	1	0	0

The prices for dinner change daily, depending on the night\\'s theme cuisine. My night was BBQ and it cost about $15.\\n\\nLike a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn\\'t GOOD. There\\'s a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that\\'s so-so, but there\\'s some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you\\'re not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.\\n\\nI found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn\\'t care for the taste, but I don\\'t have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.\\n\\nBreakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they\\'re fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don\\'t want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn\\'t disappointed. Don\\'t bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they\\'re all pretty horrible.\\n\\nOverall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don\\'t think you\\'re going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet.	0	0	0

We were trying to figure out what was the favorite but sadly, there wasn\\'t.  It was merely picking which didn\\'t suck the most.\\n\\nAmuse bouche - the only thing enjoyed - caviar and potatoes served with a shot of belvedere vodka\\n\\nTuna Tartare\\n\\nThree Seas - bad tuna, rubbery scallops, and edible sea bass served with 2 TEASPOONs of rice.\\n\\nMary\\'s Chicken - pink.\\n\\nVeal - just don\\'t. \\n\\nChef Dessert Tasting Menu - the only thing enjoyed from this sampler was the tiny chocolate chip cookies. \\n\\nBanana Tarte Tatin - this deserves a wtf.  Horrible.\\n\\nCandy bar - slightly above average.\\n\\nPeach Melba - warm vanilla cake not so much, more along the lines of a crunchy toasted warm muffin bread.\\n\\n\\nUtter waste of what SHOULD have been an extraordinary meal.	3	5	1

I asked the worker to separate the salad from the rice and the meat like five times. He didn\\'t know if he could do it. He asked another worker and the worker said it was okay to do so. He still didn\\'t understand me. He gave me a salad with no rice. Then gave me rice with meat and no salad. Then tried to combine both rice plates into one when I asked for two separate. If you\\'re confused by now, this was how I felt too. I don\\'t know how else to simply state i wanted two plates with the meat and rice separate from the salad. Please train your workers or at least have more workers working. Placing an order especially in an assembly line type restaurant like this one should not have to take 10 min especially with me being the only person there!\\n\\nFood was mediocre. I\\'ve had better Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The chicken schwarma was way better than the beef in my opinion. It was more moist. Top it with some cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, garbanzo beans, and taziki sauce and you have yourself a meal.	3	1	0

Corking fee which is no big deal I ordered the 22oz bone in Ribeye and my lady had the waygu fillet not sure if I spelled that right but anyway the ribeye was a decent price but I\\'d rather take the drive down the street to Ruth Criss and my lady\\'s steak had a little to much garlic but if you want the football game with your dinner this is the place football won it that 4th star	0	0	0

Why did I come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the Las Vegas strip?\\n\\n1 reason: Truffle Parmesan potato chips. they are like crack, you simply can\\'t stop eating them :)\\n\\nI ordered the Certified Piedmontese steak, NY Strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. At 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.\\n\\nGirlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and said it was very good.\\n\\nService is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at Delmoncio!	2	2	3

No one was in the front & we didn\\'t know if we were supposed to seat ourselves. There were a lot of paper menus in the front & when we got seated & menus weren\\'t given to us, we were confused if we were supposed to take them with us from the front. Our waitress ended up getting us menus after taking care of another table. She didn\\'t ask if we wanted drinks for quite some time. I ended up getting the lunch special & my boyfriend got the AYCE. At first I didn\\'t realize that there were no utensils at our table & I had to wait literally 10 minutes to ask for chopsticks. It took another 7-10 minutes to get the ginger/wasabi AFTER we got our sushi. The sushi was okay. My boyfriend enjoyed a lot of the rolls. It was only us and 2 other families so I really don\\'t understand where our waitress was going. She\\'d disappear a couple of times. Tables next to us were putting their empty plates on top of tables next to them because no plates were being picked up. Ok sushi but probably not coming back.	0	0	0

After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in. \\n\\nThe bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, \\"No.\\" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said \\"no you can not\\" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he \\"wasn\\'t about to send any food back because it was too soupy.\\" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn\\'t resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn\\'t like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn\\'t be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said \\"don\\'t forget to pay for these.\\" We hadn\\'t had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn\\'t want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn\\'t have pay for the drinks that we never touched. \\n\\nWe left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service.	0	0	0

My best friend took me here for my birthday last night and it was my first time going. I\\'ve heard great things about this place so I was excited to come here! Well it completely surpassed any and all expectations! The food was AMAZING! The shrimp was so good! I almost asked for more! The meat kabobs were so tender! I usually don\\'t like meat because sometimes their too chewy, but it just melted in your mouth! I had never tried couscous and I must say I\\'m glad that my first time trying it was here because it was sooooo fluffy and the chicken literally fell off the bone! AND THE DESSERT! OMG!! probably the best thing I\\'ve ever tasted! At this point I was stuffed beyond belief but when the dessert came out I could not help myself! It\\'s a Nutella/chocolate banana filled filo dough pastry baked and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon along with a hot tea! Perfect way to end a delicious meal! I cannot wait to go back!	0	0	0

Was driving around and all of sudden craving boba. Location of this spot isn\\'t the best, but it is close enough to Chinatown area. You may judge this place by the outside thinking it\\'s not all that, but once you walk in its a warm welcoming feeling. The design is very creative. My first order for this place is Hokkaido smoothie boba for me, and Wintermelon smoothie boba for my girlfriend. Wasn\\'t disappointed in the taste Becuase usually the ice overtakes the flavor but this time the flavor overtakes the ice. The honey boba texture was good and chewy. Ordered a small and their size seems like a medium which is good. It took a little while to get our drinks that\\'s Becuase they want to make its taste very well. This place is still brand new just open last week so they are still learning. I\\'m glad this place has stamp cards. The service was very genuine. Will come back again !!	4	1	1

The goblet was good but pretty overpriced at $39 and really lacking in the alcohol department for the money. \\n\\nI had high hopes for this place at first, but then our food came out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and after my first bite knew something was wrong. After the bite I inspected my food and the chicken was very very undercooked. They were super apologetic, brought me new food and didn\\'t charge me for my dinner. They also brought us a free dessert, which was appreciated. Again, the service was great. Later that night I got extremely stomach sick though and I know it was from the bite of raw chicken. Can\\'t go back because of that...	1	0	0

I\\'m forever recommending their Ceasar Salad, fried mac and cheese balls, and Red Velvet Cheesecake. The only flaw is their seating. If you\\'re upstairs near the railing, be careful. There\\'s nothing covering the fence part, so if you drop a knife (as I did) you /will/ hit someone. Luckily, it landed between her back and the booth but still. They need to fix that. After the incident, the manager just told me to keep my silverware away from that side to avoid another mishap. \\n\\nThat mishap would never happen again if they fixed that, but still. Always A+ food no matter the location. The staff is super friendly. :)	0	0	0

However, for me, it was free since I have loyalty points, otherwise you\\'ll spend $26 for weekend champagne brunch. \\nWith that said, if you are staying at the hotel, or like many options, its not bad. you could do worse (excalibur). \\nI do like that I can try many things, multiple glasses of champagne, however, I tend to stick to the basics... which is safer and I know I\\'ll like it.	2	1	1

It was very flavorful pork and a good sized portioned.  The veggies were perfectly pickled and loved the extra cilantro.  Bread was fresh crunchy on the outside soft and absorbant on the inside. The only downside was the service, I think they are short staffed, I waited a long time before I could even get my to go ordrer in. But definitely would go again for a sit down meal. 4$ for the sandwich !! great price!	0	0	0

This time we only had a party of 4 (last time we had a party of at least 20).  The service of course was still great.\\n\\nWe started with the tuna/salmon tar tare - wasn\\'t mediocre but still good\\n\\nThe men ordered the bone-in rib eyes and the ladies ordered the petite rib eye special - that came with a marrow/wine sauce over the steaks in place of butter.  My husband and I both ordered ours medium-rare, the other pair ordered theirs medium.  When we received our steaks, they ended up giving everyone the wrong steaks.  The other couple seemed to have enjoyed our medium-rare steaks though!\\n\\nWe ended our dinner sharing 2 desserts, the banana creme pie and creme brulee - both were yummy.\\n\\nOutside of our mixed up orders, we will definitely be back.  Their steaks melt like butta!	0	0	0

Went on a Friday night and the music was great a lot of early 2000 hip hop and r&b. The place was very clean and the setup was well thought out. The tables are park benches and each sit about 12 guests (Im assuming.) there is also bar seating and stools around the perimeter of the place where you can get the best view. There are also couches to lounge around on. the beer selection is great, didn\\'t ask if they had double IPAs but I\\'m sure they do. Our waitress was great, I don\\'t remember her name but she\\'s Asian and very friendly. Service was quick and the food was good too.	0	0	0

This restaurant was fairly busy and had good reviews, so we decided to try it. We are from Hawaii, where there are quite a few Chinese restaurants so we thought ordering would be easy. Wow, the menu was quite extensive and some of the dishes were not familiar. We choose the crispy chicken and salt & pepper squid. The food was good and no complaints.\\n\\nAnother wow on the portions. We had more than enough for breakfast. \\n\\nThe service was great and they even comped soup and dessert for us. I would definitely return here on our next trip to Vegas.  Mahalo.	0	0	0

At first glance thought it might be closed.. windows looked dark and it was 10:00 but they were open and we were the only ones there.. thought about leaving just because if nobody else is brave enough there\\'s usually a reason.. glad we stayed!! This is a family run place.. the older lady waits tables.. I think she\\'s the wife and owner.. the husband and son are the chefs. She was very sweet and accommodating.. always offering offering more and I eat a lot so that says something..\\n\\nThe Jalapeno Bombs (aka poppers) are the best in town.. as are the monkey brain and the First Class roll.. All off the charts good.. Everything was great thats what was crazy.. they didnt miss!! The food quality is top notch.. as this place was a la carte and still serves a la carte quality at ALCE prices.. I\\'ve been to ALOT of off strip sushi bars in town..

It was pretty standard- self-serve froyo with a few flavors and lots of toppings.  The flavors could stand a change to something more unique, but they did have a wide variety of toppings.  Price was decent, too.  Overall not a bad place for a quick foryo stop if you really need a fix, but with the many other options for froyo, ice cream and other treats in Vegas, you may want to look elsewhere.  The crepes looked good, but sadly no time to try them.	0	0	0

Parking lot is a bit confusing, but who cares it is so worth it.  One thing though, the fries animal style were a bit too over-cheesed for me and I felt gross after having the already rich burger, although that didn\\'t stop me from finishing everything.

I had the combination beef pho and the soup was on point. I loved the hot chili sauce they had along with sirarcha. They served generous amount of mint and lime. The server was fast. The Vietnamese coffee here comes with a expresso draining into condensed milk. Then you get to mix it yourself before pouring into the cup of ice. This baby is strong. Kept me awake for rest of the afternoon at lecture. Came here with my wife and long time friend. Both of them enjoyed their pho very much as well. I haven\\'t had pho for awhile and this place definitely delivered!	0	0	0

Sure not rude however I felt like I just walked into Denny\\'s at 2:30 am for some pancakes. The wait staff was prompt however I would have rather been served by Denny\\'s. They not nice and unattentive. They made us feel like it was best if we just hurried finished our meal. Of course we occommidated them becuase once started eating the food was certainly good quality but way over salted. It was very pasty. Odds are unless someone else insists I wont be visting again. Why when there are so many other great choices. One more thing. The restaurant really had no theme.  White walls coupled with the staff it felt like an expensive hospital cafeteria.	0	0	0

The price is a little high but everything downtown is gonna cost you a pretty penny. The quality of beef is very good and delicious.

Upgraded my dish for a side dish and drink. Got the Parsley Fries, which were yum! And after seeing reviews about this cucumber drink, you know I had to try! It was very refreshing.

When my partner and I arrived, we were the only ones there. The seating arrangement is lounge-like and is along the perimeter of the room so that the center becomes the \\"stage\\" for the performances. I could clearly tell that the restaurant entertains group dinners, but the corners have seating for couples if need be.\\n\\nFoodwise? I never tried Moraccan food, so as an entry eater, I thought the food was great. Authentic? Not sure since it\\'s my first time, but since I enjoyed it,  I would definitely consider finding a local restaurant which serves authentic Moraccan recipes. \\n\\nI probably over did it with the bread because I ate it with everything...enough where I couldn\\'t really finish my last two courses. But the bread was so yummy. It\\'s soft in the middle but holds up liquids/sauces well.\\n\\nFood for thought: It was my anniversary dinner. My guy said, \\"Fogo?\\" I said, \\"For the same price, let\\'s try something different.\\" It definitely was different. It was worth going the road less traveled.	0	0	0

It\\'s a very welcoming restaurant especially late after hours, since they\\'re open 24/7. The food is your typical diner fare, anything you want served all day. The desserts are great too.

Very strong tea but not sweet at all. I did order a regular size with boba but ended up adding some honey to my drink once I got home. I\\'m not sure if they have sweetener in their cream but next one I\\'ll stick to a regular house green milk tea.\\n\\nI also ordered a regular Hokkaido milk tea and wanted to add less milk but was told that they can\\'t adjust it because it\\'s a powder and premade. Brew tea allows for adjustments on their Hokkaido milk tea. The Hokkaido milk tea is ok, not overly sweet but definitely not one of my favorites. \\n\\nSome people compared tea space so half & half. I\\'m from SoCal and LOVE half and half so I\\'ll be back to try their iced milk drinks.	4	1	2

Overall, this place is OK and the staff has always been very friendly and the place looks very clean.  First visit was mix plate of quarter chicken and 2 Ribs. Ribs were OK, not great. Chicken was dry but edible. Second visit was Ribs and pulled pork. Again, ribs were OK and the pulled pork was pretty good, but again nothing special. Last night got just a pork sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese the lady recommended. Got home and opened container to see not a BBQ sandwich but a BBQ hoagie.  Absolutely atrocious. A hoagie changes the texture and flavor of the sandwich and is too much bread.  I paid $9.99 for a plate of bread with a few tablespoons of meat. In full disclosure I was raised in the deep South where exceptional BBQ is found on every street. If you\\'re looking for a clean place that is better than most options available in Las Vegas, it\\'s a good option.	0	0	0

However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\\n\\nIt was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\\n\\nThe wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\\n\\nNow on to the steak.- the \\"signature\\" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend\\'s filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.\\n\\nNow on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!\\n\\nAll in all, Emeril\\'s Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...	0	0	1

For the manager reading I give you this post in hopes to help your bar out. First off, the dollar a hand keno is too much for comped drinks, only bar I have been to that does this. The bartenders let you know you need to play a dollar to get comped. Second the bartenders should introduce themselves by name. There is also something about giving a little to get customers to come back, I see this at the very successful bars. I looked around and the bar was empty and hardly anyone was gambling. My friend asked to have the TV changed to a hockey game and the bartenders said no. I understand the bar business is tough, but I think the bartenders are hurting the business as we will never go back, remedys is a perfect example of why the bar is successful, the bartenders are great and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel good.	1	0	0

But all others lack when it comes to taste and variety. \\nA simple bowl already comes with great flavor. When you add the sauce they have, the taste is magnified.

My boyfriend and I were like, \\"it\\'s cool...things happen.\\" As he went to go scavenge for more pickles I noticed we did not receive bread with our meat platter. When we asked for the bread, the food runner looked confused and out of place. .... (how can you eat paté by itself or meats and mustard w/o any bread.  It\\'s like ordering a pizza with no dough.). We were polite upon asking for our bread as it clearly states it is included on the menu.\\n\\nI usually wouldn\\'t write a 1 star review of this caliber as I see them being a decent warning, yet a waste of time. However, I wouldn\\'t want anybody wasting their time at this establishment.	0	0	0

Well, I would in an ideal world, but after being burned so many times, I just wanted one place that measures up to my Californian standards. I think my quest is finally over after lunch yesterday.\\n\\nAll you really need is a hot flavorful broth, lots of delicious meat, reasonable noodles, and some thai basil and lime on the side. The pho dac biet (#5 [EDIT: appetizers are #1-#4] on the menu) came out very quickly after I placed the order (not a busy lunch hour). It satisfied my palate entirely, and it was very filling, about the same as a typical large pho somewhere else (there\\'s only one size here) and very much worth the $7.49.\\n\\nI also ended up with two cha gio (egg rolls) from the free Yelp check-in offer. They were very crunchy and filled with pork, carrots, and mushrooms the way I\\'m used to having them, which is not the same as your typical Chinese egg roll with lettuce and whatever mush is in the filling. A quick wrap in lettuce and a dunk in nuoc mam was all I needed for a nice appetizer.\\n\\nPho Kim Long, Lemongrass Cafe, and Da Lat all failed the test, but Kinh Do has passed with flying colors. Other than the Mexican server, they\\'d fit perfectly in San Jose. Actually, given the demographic trends, I guess they\\'d still fit.	6	3	4

We were a group of six who went in with a BOGO coupon created by Coasta Cantina expressly for our convention at the nearby Orleans Arena.  After a lot of needless debate (the coupon was really straightforward, but he tried to make it sound ambiguous), the manager refused to honor the coupon. He also didn\\'t want to push two tables together to allow us to be more comfortable, and opted instead to have 6 of us sit at a small round table. Weird, but we complied with that. This was at 9 PM on a weeknight, so the place was pretty much empty.\\n\\nThere are too many details to include them all in this review, so I\\'ll just sum up with this feedback for management/owners:  own your mistake while we are still at the table, and not after we\\'ve already walked out the door. Seat us where we are most comfortable, and not what\\'s most convenient for you (especially when the restaurant is practically empty).	0	0	0

This was an additional $55 total (1 glass per person, per course).  The wine pairing was very good.  \\n\\nTuna tartare and salad were both excellent.  Miso cod and filet were also great.  Filet was not cooked medium (it was medium well) as requested but still had great flavor (so we did not send it back).

They have twenty drafts that are constantly changing. Some beers may only last a week, some longer, but they don\\'t have anything permanently, so there is almost always something new.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable, with most 16oz pours in the $5 to $6 range. They always have a few high gravity pours that run $8 to $9 for 8oz, but they are usually worth it. And they will almost always let you taste whatever you want. I usually only get the expensive stuff during happy hour, when all drafts are two dollars off. They even comp the 16oz pours if your gambling ($1 average of course).\\n\\nSpeaking of happy hour, it\\'s 4pm to 6pm everyday but Sunday, when happy hour is all day long. If you have a growler they will fill it for half price on Sundays. This makes most of their beers $10 for a growler fill, and $22.50 for the pricy stuff. Honestly you can\\'t beat that price for 64 ounces of high quality beer.\\n\\nOne more note on happy hour, they have half priced pizza and food specials. There half price pizza is obviously homemade and blows PTs half price pizza out of the water. Most of the delivery pizza places I have tried around here aren\\'t near as good, and you can get a pie for under $10 during happy hour.\\n\\nAnd all there food is good. I\\'ve never had anything here I didn\\'t like. They are known for their mac and cheese and have some great sandwiches.\\n\\nOh and we love the staff. All the bartenders are friendly and do a great job. Dani and Kim are who we usually see (based on the hours when we come in) and they are great, but everyone else we have met had been good to.\\n\\nI honestly have friends and coworkers that have told me how lucky I am to live down the street from this place. They have two locations, though I have never been to the other one, but I can attest that the Nellis location is awesome. If you are a fan of beer and/or bar food, and you are on the east side, this is a must try.	3	1	0

I thought it\\'d be a hole in the wall place but it\\'s actually very nice inside.  The wall painting and the music create a nice relaxing island ambience.\\n\\n  I\\'m still not too used to eating with my hands because sometimes I like a spoonful of yumminess.  My favorite was the chicken and lamb dishes.  The chicken was cooked in tomato based spicy sauce.  The lamb was cooked well with onion and jalapeño.  I didn\\'t care much for their veggie platter.  The red and yellow colored been pastes didn\\'t sit well with my taste buds.  The spinach, cabbage and a couple of other veggies were ok but nothing special.  I\\'d order more meat dishes if I go there again.  I also saw some beef dish on sizzling plates going to other tables looked very good.  The service was decent.	1	0	1

I saw that a friend had many check ins here. And since she is an \\"Elite\\" what ever she writes must be taken as the gospel. I have been to this location several times over the years for tasty Banh Mi sandwiches. Back in the day I got several picky coworkers to eat the sandwiches without knowing what was inside. Man if they only knew what was in there!\\n \\n  The parking lot was packed and it was hard to find a spot. We thought it might be really busy inside judging from the amount of cars there. Sharon L. kept saying that if it\\'s too busy let\\'s just go to Jollibee. I said with so many good reviews and seeing that the Duchess is an \\"Elite\\" this has to be a must eat! \\n\\n  As we walked in I thought maybe we should expect to be given a flasher and told a wait time. But this was not necessary seeing as we were the ONLY patrons there at 8 pm on a Friday night. O.k there was one other woman there but since the waiter was sitting at her table and talking her up. Something  about  are you a cocktail waitress? And you look good you should be! The restaurant seemed a little bit below capacity.\\n\\n  Anyway he came and sat us and gave us some menus. Sharon L. asked if I was having Pho or \\"Faux\\"? Since I have come to the conclusion that \\"Faux\\" is a waste of money. I told her politely no thanks, I will be having a couple of the tasty sandwiches tonight. See laughed and said your eating a sandwich at a \\"Faux\\' place? Yeah and here\\'s why, when you eat \\"Faux\\" you get the faux feeling that your full. You go back to your office, fire up some spreadsheets and in a couple of hours your hungry again. With only that old bag of flaming hot cheetos from the back of you desk to cure your hunger. No thanks!\\n \\n  Sharon L. seeing that I was right about the \\"Faux\\" feeling ordered a sandwich with grilled pork and some spring rolls. I ordered two of the special pork sandwiches, I guess at any other place this would be called the #1. The food came fast and my sandwich tasted very good. I also enjoyed the spring rolls with sriracha sauce. Sharon L. spent most of the dinner dissecting her sandwich and picking out things that she deemed ugly. All in all a good meal with good service. \\nSince my water glass was never empty, I went in the back past all the cleaning supplies and boxes to the surprisingly clean restroom! When I returned I was welcomed by the bill with a total of $17.23. A very good price for what we got.\\n\\n   For all the people reading the reviews about getting \\"Faux\\" I quote. \\"And still to this day, I have NEVER EVER looked down at my meat and saw that green, silver, purple metallic tinge of color that I often see at other pho places.\\" - Debra W \\"Elite\\". \\n\\nWhy even take a chance on  getting \\"Faux\\" belly and  some janky meat. Eat a sandwich!	3	3	3

However, the last visit in 2010 was a big disappointment. The food was just average and the service was terrible.

Side note: Downtown Vegas is so getting so out of this world awesome!\\n\\nReally..the only downside to this place is that it\\'s rather small and so there\\'s almost always a sizable wait at peak times. I like the service, the decor is not out of this world but always makes me comfortable and the food is solid. The menu is short and sweet and a large number of dishes can be made vegetarian. We like their spring rolls, tom yum soup, ginger fried rice, massaman curry, basil noodles and awesome noodles. \\n\\nThe drinks menu is pretty solid with some interesting cocktail concoctions and Asian beer options.

They made it weekends only and honestly, I can\\'t blame them. There is not a buffet in town (if there is, please let me know) that does champagne brunch during weekdays so they could do away with it just fine. However, that also takes away a big appeal for me to go eat here. Bring back the champagne weekdays and I\\'ll be back! Without it, I\\'d only eat there if it was convenient. Certainly won\\'t go out of my way for it.	0	0	0

Walk into restaurant and order your dish. Select the fresh toppings behind the glass wall. \\n\\nThe chix and steak on the rotating vertical spit were flavorful without overdoing it on the spices/garlic. Their salad  is a mixture of fresh cut lettuce, cabbages, beans, cucumbers and tomatoes. The steak meat on my salad plate were crispy smaller pieces of about 1 cup of meat. I expected the shaved gyro style of 1/2 inch meat strips, but their layered steak style spit mound made for smaller but crispier tidbit pieces. Good.\\n\\nThe hummus was outstanding. I would\\'ve been happy just eating the hummus and pita if I had to.\\n\\nI diluted their green cucumber lemonade drink with water and ice. Refreshing. Too sweet for this sour-puss.\\n\\nWant to try their curries next.\\n\\nPrice point is very reasonable. I like that you can pick and choose your veggie toppings and  sauces. Great concept.	1	1	1

So we hoofed it all the way to the opposite end and was shocked that it was $39.99 per person.  By that point, we were kind of stuck so we paid it.  But the food was very good with lots of choices.  The carving station had 3 different types of beef which is unusual, along with turkey and kielbasa.  The carver didn\\'t seem to understand English well, those of us getting meat had to point to what we wanted.  There were self-serve beverage stations on each end of the room, along with a small bar.  I had a glass of wine, which was okay and only cost $6.00.  Overall, it was a decent buffet, just overpriced but then, many of them are now.  The Strip in general hikes the prices up for the tourists, forgetting that many locals would go there more if it was reasonable.	0	0	0

This place is tiny and narrow and when we got there, it was not even busy. After ordering and waiting, a ton of ppl from nowhere came in and the place was jam packed.  \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n01.  Mango Green Tea - $3.66 - 3 Stars\\n- Green Tea was bitter and dark, Mango syrup was a bit too sweet. It was just okay.\\n\\n02.  House Milk Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars\\n- Smooth milk tea w/ Honey Boba.  I\\'m not a fan of Honey Bobas at all but the kids loved it.\\n\\n03.  Okinawa Milk Tea - $3.66 - 4 Stars\\n- Smooth and Creamy but we\\'ve had better in Cali. The portion of sweetness and tea was perfect. Do recommend always ordering \\"Okinawa Mik\\" if it is offered.\\n\\n04.  Passion Fruit Black Tea w/ Honey Boba - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 3 Stars\\n- Good Passion Fruit flavor, not too bitter or sweet.\\n\\n05.  Oolong Milk Tea w/ Boba  - $3.66 + .50 Boba = $4.16 - 4 Stars\\n- Oolong tea is a better option if you\\'re not into the dark or bitter teas. Tastes lighter and are smooth with Milk Teas. \\n\\nLOCATION - In a tiny shopping plaza, tiny internal space. Depending on where you are on the street you have to make a U-turn to see it. \\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - Not the FRIENDLIEST or the FASTEST, but I\\'m used to Cali Tea Houses where the volumes of people are much higher.  We waited 20 minutes for our 5 drinks. Prices are decent for the cup size you get. It\\'s the same price for the regular or large so why not just get the larger one right. The definitely can improve on the speed of getting the tea orders. \\n\\nGOOD THINGS - They have a Stamp Card for frequent buyers so you can get free drinks. Pick one up if you are from Vegas.  \\n\\nVERDICT - Good teas for Vegas but we have so many amazing one in Cali that Cali Tea Houses are still my FAVE ones.  But when I\\'m in Vegas next, I\\'ll stop by to get my stamp card punched.	2	0	1

On a Sunday night we stopped for dinner. I had the most fluffy,buttery tasting pancakes I\\'ve ever eaten. Also, they were huge! I had no idea when the server asked if I wanted 3 or 5 that was a tip. Since I love pancakes of course I said 5!  the plate arrived and I knew this was going to be a personal challenge. I failed, I made a great attempt but could only eat 2. However, I will tell you they warmed up great the next day! We revisited for lunch a few days later. I had the Chilaqules Verde. Delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and tbe sauces were wonderful. Definitely recommend this as a stop on your trip.	0	0	0

They went as far as to watch the cameras to see how many plates of food we grabbed..... On what planet is that normal? We were trying to find something worth a shit to eat at the worst buffet in Vegas. Excuse the shit outta me for not trying to just give yall $30 for dinner and then leave.\\n\\nI would honestly rather starve than ever come eat here again. \\n\\nPlease avoid this place at all costs. It\\'s honestly not worth it. Just go to McDonald\\'s across the street.	0	0	0

I gave the server $20 for two drinks when I received my drinks and she didn\\'t have change on the spot. She claimed that the bar tender was the one to ring everything up and give change. It took about 15 minutes to get my change, enough of an irritant to move on and never patronize this bar again.Seems to me that this lounge needs to make a major process change in the way it handles transactions. I\\'m sure there\\'s an army of consultants that can help out in that regard. \\n\\nSayonara forever Mizuya.	5	6	6

Maybe it was an \\"off\\" night for the cooks or something, but I didn\\'t taste anything significant. I tried the shrimp salad, the greens were fresh, the shrimp was nicely sized and tasty.

I didn\\'t expect to have good, genuine food in Las Vegas, but if you get away from the strip and go downtown, you can find Le Thai.\\n\\nNot only is it a cool, casual atmosphere, but the server is friendly and laid-back. They have a check-in deal for one free hug. Thought that was legit. Need to go back and redeem at some point.\\n\\nWent with some folks I had basically just met, and we ordered a number of dishes and just shared. Everything was soooo good. I couldn\\'t believe it. Not much else to say. If you live there, go there. If you visit Vegas, and need to get away from the lights and the solicitors, then this is a great area and a great restaurant.	2	0	1

It was a little after 8:00pm, we were seated by a friendly guy. \\n\\nWe immediately placed our order, as we are regulars there and we were starving, the server, an older hispanic woman took our order. We recieved our 2 beers promtly. 20 minutes later she came back to check on us, we asked about our food, she said it was coming. \\n\\n45 minutes later we asked about our food again, our server never placed our order, then she frantically tried to put it in without aknowloging what happened.\\n\\nThe people that were seated after us were eating their meal. There were only 3 tables total, including us, so they were not super busy. I don\\'t understand it.\\n\\nWe were starving, we tried to leave but she acted offended that we wanted to leave. Took forever with the bill. we had to look at a menu so we could calculate how much it would be, so we could leave cash and get out of there. She handed it to us as we were walking out, there was already cash on the table.\\n\\nShe never apologized, never brought our food, oh but she did charge us for the beers. I think the owners of this place are great and the food is awesome, but the staff needs quite a bit of work. When they\\'re not there to supervise, service sucks.\\n\\nIf she would have apologized, comped our beers or simply brought us a free appetizer we would have been satisfied. Instead, I\\'m still upset and writting this review. We went to Mob Bar, our food was served in less than 10 minutes.	0	0	0

The service was confusing, it took us over  30 min to get our appetizers, which in my opinion took way too long.

I had a craving for some oysters so after the waiter recommendation I ordered the seafood platter for 2 and expected nice big plump oysters, shrimp, king crab, and lobster but instead got the total opposite. For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos).\\nThe popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides. The portion of the mash potato was a joke - 2 spoons and it was gone; how can that be enough for even one person let alone sharing.  Same for the asparagus and mushrooms.\\nSpending over $400 plus tip we left feeling unfulfilled and hungry.	2	1	0

the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\\n\\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie\\'s Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city\\'s best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\\n\\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril\\'s famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.	5	3	5

We were told it was lady\\'s night on Thursday at the chocolate Lounge, which was find but didn\\'t realize we could here anything but the music.  We had 15 people with us so most conversation was through text lol.  Very cute place.  \\n\\nReason for getting a one star was the service.  Knowing the music was so loud why would you try to talk to me from across the table.  After ordering our food it had taken a good 35-40 for appetizers.  It wasn\\'t busy.  Even for a house salad!  Come on now.  Everyone food didn\\'t come out at the same time.  3 hours later and 20 minutes for the bill.  I was over it not worth $761.  We all wanted desserts but didn\\'t want to wait another hour.  \\n\\nMaking the reservations was hard enough to get through.  With one person telling me I had to go through a group with a set menu.  And another telling me we didn\\'t.  Where is the communication?  For being on the Las Vegas strip you would think service would be on point.	2	0	0

This was our third trip to Vegas and the more I go, the less I want to eat at a casino. The casino buffets are convenient but I always feel I just paid 25.99$ to eat at Old Country Buffet! \\n\\nAte breakfast two mornings in a row. This place is open 24/7 and you can get any item at any time. First morning I had the Chicken Waffles, West Coast style, it\\'s a big home made waffle with home made chicken fingers put on top of it with yummy salted butter scooped into it and you just pour the syrup over ever thing. Sweet and salty, very good! I was with friends and there was an order of steak and eggs with pancakes at our table. Their pancakes are amazing. Big, light, and fluffy  with big scoops of the salted butter... UMMMMM food coma! Oh yes and not to be forgotten coffee was excellent and service was amazing. Waitress was happy to serve us, and was always refilling coffee and water glasses. \\n\\nSecond morning.... I wasn\\'t in the mood for breakfast, we were getting ready to leave Las Vegas via car to Los Angeles and I didn\\'t want anything too sweet. So I had the bacon cheese burger and fries.... excellent! Friends had the chorizo omelet and the other one had the french toast. I had thought their best plate was pancakes... I was wrong, the french toast was even better. Everything was perfect, right amount of being cooked, not soggy, not squished, not hard, cinnamon and powered sugar and then the salted butter on top.... it was the best french toast I\\'ve ever eaten.  \\n\\nWe will be back to Vegas at the end of our road trip and we plan on going back. The waitresses and the manager (or owner?) spent time talking to us and made us feel welcomed.  This is absolutely a don\\'t miss when you are in Vegas.	0	0	0

The host was very welcoming and the restaurant had a very inviting curb appeal.  We had a party of 4 and we were welcomed at our table by a very good waitress with a bowl of spicy and sweet peanuts that held us over as we reviewed the menu.  \\n\\nWe sat on the back patio under some beautiful murals and attractive lighting.  The music was very cool and had a nice reggae vibe.  \\n\\nWe ordered crab rangoon to start which were wonderful and had some drinks as well.  For entrees we had pad thai with chicken, eggplant with shrimp, and yellow curry with tofu.  Each of these plates was really tasty and was a perfect amount of food for four.\\n\\nWe sat down at about 5:15pm on a Friday and the tables were already filling up.  Get there early to enjoy this gem located in the up and coming East Fremont District.	1	0	1

In short, the service was outstanding!  Our head waiter was Michael and the manager on the floor was Vincent.   We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!\\n\\nObviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.  We will return.	0	0	0

Little pricey, but conveniently located if you live or play downtown. Unless you are a glutton for punishment, do not order a dish with spicy  #5 (spice levels are 1-5, five being the hottest). I love spicy food, but when I ordered the awesome noodles with spice level 5, it was insane. It took me three days to eat. Very good though.	0	0	0

Rancho Drive, which meant there is another WildBurger location to try out.  After visit two locations now, both appeared to share similar interior design implementation.  It is a casual local casino diner serving burgers, hotdogs, wings, and breakfast items, but looks pretty new and clean.\\n\\nLast time I was at a WildBurger, I tried their WildBurger so I thought I try out their other signature burgers at this location.  That meant ordering The Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich and The Cajun Turkey Burger.  Both were good, but the clear winner was definitely The Cajun Turkey Burger (tasted better and not as heavy).\\n\\nThe Fried Onion String was also a lot better here than the one I tried before, and I killed it all this time around, instead of leaving most of it on the plate.\\n\\nThe Honey Garlic Boneless Wings had great flavor, was not spicy at all (for a medium), but it is made with cut up chicken breast pieces.  Even though it was fried perfectly and is moist inside, I think I will stick to the real chicken wings next time.\\n\\n4 stars for good food at a reasonable price, friendly service in a clean casino diner that does not overly reek of cigarette smoke.  Plus there was no line to wait in to be seated or to place an order on my visit.\\n\\nOh yeah, in another month or so, they will expand their menu at all locations.  So will be interesting to see what else they cook up for the new menu.	3	2	2

First off it was Feb 15th, day after Valentine\\'s Day, they charged me 33% more for the buffet, claiming a holiday event/weekend. But did not discover this till after the fact. You would expect something special for the upcharge! Absolutely not.\\nVery limited selection! Tried 3 different vegies all were barely room temperature, I wish the health department was present checking temps. Most meats were overcooked, dry chicken smothered in sauces. I could go on...\\nYuck.	1	0	0

I also got the vegetarian ramen and it tasted like a glorified $.69 ramen from the grocery store. The broth was bland and had nothing special about it. The noodles were cooked fine but I was just disappointed with the flavor to the soup adorned with only bamboo and mushrooms. It was not worth $9 and I will not be ordering it again. It was also frustrating that although we wanted to eat ramen only, They were not seating in that room and we had to Wait 45 mins for a table at bachi burger side. What\\'s the point of being connected if u won\\'t use both restaurant spaces? Esp when some people only want food from shoku only? There were 5 other parties also waiting for a long time for a table and had to wait till\\nThe packed bachi burger had open tables. Makes no sense.	1	2	0

I wanted chicken wings but the cashier said they didn\\'t have any and it would take 15 minutes to make more.\\nThe place has bright colors minimal design and it looks dirty and the trash cans were overflowing with garbage. It took us a minute to find a clean table. Most of the tables had old food on it. \\nThe first thing that you will notice, which made us disappointed was trash near the counter that the employees kept walking past.\\nThe service was absolutely disappointing. In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something. I asked the manager to clean the restaurant lobby where customers were eating and she said, \\"okay, thank you.\\" I asked the cashier for more salad dressing, it took some time to get her attention.\\nIn conclusion the whole experience was not good, I would never go back to this place again for any reason and I don\\'t recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy.\\n\\nIn a few words...you are better off trying McDonalds on the Rainbow and Sahara. That bad!!	1	0	0

My family and I ordered the oysters, tuna tartar, crab legs, rib eye, filet mignon, onion rings, lobster, and green beans. \\n\\nOysters - I\\'m not a big oyster fan but the one oyster I did have tasted fresh and was good. My parents love oysters and they dug this dish so that\\'s safe enough to say that the oysters here are good quality. \\n\\nTuna Tartar - Fresh fish and great sauce. Awesome. \\n\\nCrab Legs - Not as meaty as I thought they\\'d be, they were seriously lacking. \\n\\nOnion Rings - These were terrible. Not crispy at all, they were borderline soft and mushy. I don\\'t know what was going on when they made these, but the taste of soft batter and hot oil made me feel sick. \\n\\nRib Eye - I don\\'t know why, but my steak was literally charred. I understand when you cook steak it\\'s supposed to have marks on it, but this was unbelievable, all I was tasting was burned leather. \\n\\nFilet Mignon - Good cause it wasn\\'t as charred as the rib eye. \\n\\nLobster - Easily the best. Great tasting, fresh, and meaty. \\n\\nGreen Beans - Typical green beans you\\'d find at any steak restaurant. They\\'re okay. \\n\\nThe service was good, the price is about what you\\'d expect at any steakhouse, and the restaurant is kept clean and tidy. The ambiance is good and there is a romantic atmosphere to the dimly lit restaurant floor. This place has its hits and misses and averages out to a decent place to get dinner. I would come back again.	0	0	0

All you can eat steak, omelets,  crab, salmon,  just to name a few. The price had gone up, but what hasn\\'t. Westgate resorts took over from LVH, so far the same.

The servers were very friendly and helpful as we selected from the several options for each course. They also warned us that nine of 10 people cannot finish all the courses, and they were right. But we finished most and took the rest back to the hotel to enjoy later. For so much good food, the price was quite reasonable ($29 each). We will put this on our dinner list again the next time we\\'re in Vegas.	0	0	0

Everyone I tell that I eat the raw beef dish Kitfo thinks it is the weirdest thing ever, but when they try it they are converted. The one thing that bugs me is that despite coming here several times, everytime we order the kitfo they ask if we would like it cooked a little? No! we want the authentic deal. Also the injera bread is great; slightly sour, spongy and addictive. Really like the Tibbs dish. It is a funny contrast from raw (Kitfo) to well done, but both are great. Lastly I liked the dark Ethiopian beer. Cannot remember the name, but I liked it better than the St. George. All in all very good food.	0	0	0

I waited 15 mins which was fine until I sat down and saw 5 open tables.  (6 for mine) It took 20 mins more to seat 4 more groups waiting after me on those tables.  So we ordered miso ramen and I didn\\'t want the mushrooms or corn and asked for extra green onions instead. I still got charged a 1.50 but I was advised. The broth was good and not too rich but my noodles were so mushy and over cooked.  The only good thing was the gyoza,  Prolly the best gyoza in Vegas I\\'ll give them that.  But service is slow, (not our server the others)  it\\'s not like they\\'re short staffed,  just slow.	2	0	1

Their wings are also really good.\\n\\nAccess 3/5\\n\\nIt\\'s really hard to get there! They don\\'t have their own parking so you must park somewhere downtown which usually means you\\'re paying. I know this is the case in most big cities but in Las Vegas there are plenty of other great restaurants you can go to that are more convenient.\\n\\nWait 3/5\\n\\nThere\\'s always a long wait because there isn\\'t much seating. They also don\\'t take reservations which is a negative for me.\\n\\nOverall 4/5\\n\\nI still go to Le Thai about once every couple months because the food is great but if it was in a different location, with parking and more seating, I would go much more often!	0	0	0

So I think I\\'ve been to Delmonico six or seven times and the operative word is consistency. Always great service, always great food and just overall my favorite steakhouse.\\n\\nSo what isn\\'t to like about Emeril\\'s house of meat?\\n\\nA very well stocked bar, a nice wine list and perfectly cooked steaks.\\n\\nI started with the lettuce wedges with fresh blue cheese and got the rib eye. I don\\'t know how they do it but the steaks always have this crispy, char on the outside but have a good juicy center with lots of flavor.\\n\\nWe shared the grits, corn and mushrooms as sides and they were tasty good.\\n\\nLike I said, this is a special occasion place and Delmonico has yet to disappoint. \\n\\nThanks Emeril for always making my trip to Vegas!	0	0	0

The fact you can order online & have it ready by a certain time is awesome and super convenient. Now food wise... I had heard a lot of mixed reviews from people. You either hate it or love it basically. I got the Sin City burger & the smash fries. The bun was super soft and it melts in your mouth. As far as the rest of the burger, it didn\\'t really wow me. The smash fries were the best part of my meal! Also a little on the pricey side. I might try something else next time, but as far as burgers are concerned, I\\'ll probably stick with In n Out or Five Guys.	0	0	1

We had the bbq chicken, the spicy sisig, sinigang and the pancit guisado. Can\\'t say enough how surprised I was by how delicious it all was. We are both very excited to go back and have everything else. My little Filipino angel craves her home cuisine quite often and finding this little gem was a blessing. She said it was very authentic and reminds her of a home cooked meal.	1	0	0

I\\'m looking at my original review and laughing.\\n\\nThe last two times I have been here, they have completely skimped on my tacos or really messed up our order. And here\\'s the best part: we\\'re doing online ordering. With explicit instructions. How do you mess that up?? \\n\\nThe customer service also stinks. My husband went to pick up food right before I got off work. We get home and I\\'m handing him his burrito and it\\'s ICE COLD. Like it was sitting in a freezer. There is no way our car was cold, it was a warm day out and he put it in the backseat so the dog wouldn\\'t get to it. When he bit into it, it was freezing. How the heck can that happen? My tacos were also ridiculously tiny - they were filled halfway if that. They also added guacamole which I loathe. I remember when I\\'ve gone there and the tacos are so big that I could barely eat two. Now I can eat all 3 and be hungry an hour later. NOT COOL! \\n\\nSo my husband is so upset that he goes back to Chipotle. A second time. What happens? They try to make an excuse that they made the burrito right in front of him and it couldn\\'t possibly be that cold, and all they do is remake the order. And my second tacos are just as tiny as the first. When you can grasp the top of the taco and have an entire inch on both sides, you have a problem. His burrito was HUGE - my veggie tacos were tiny. We\\'re paying the same price, so why am I getting less? \\n\\nI am so fed up with this place that I honestly can\\'t come here anymore. We used to come here about every two weeks but it\\'s annoying to have to keep going back to do things semi-correctly, and still be disappointed on now multiple occasions. It\\'s a VEGAN TACO. I am the cheapest customer you have! I shouldn\\'t have to glare and ask you to give me more of every single ingredient to get one decent taco. Maybe it\\'s just this location, because I do still like the franchise and the food, but only when it\\'s made correctly and has good customer service to back it up if something does go wrong.	3	1	1

The macaroni salad had a little bit too much mayonnaise but other than that, a really good Hawaiian/Japanese fusion place! Service was also good and the people were friendly. The price was also very reasonable. For 3 combo platter and a avocado sushi roll, it came out to about 36 dollars. The combos had a lot on the plate too. At least 2 types of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. Leaving satisfied!	0	0	0

Basically, we got what we expected with diner food, although the service was pretty friendly which surprised us after the reviews here.\\n\\nWe came here for breakfast, the last before we left Vegas, and got what we were looking for at a good price for a non-chain meal on the strip. We ordered The Whole Monte (a breakfast with a bit of everything) and the build your own omelet. The omelet was the star of the show with broccoli and mushrooms, offering something a little unique, while The Whole Monte was standard. We left filled and the service was quick and friendly (although they do try a bit too hard to push the M Life card here).\\n\\nOverall, if you are expecting food that is a little better than iHop and Denny\\'s, the place is serviceable.	0	0	0

That wasn\\'t me, but we were there to cheer on a contestant. \\n\\nMy word of advice: Be prepared for a long wait for this monster meat. Even for 3lbs, the wait was bordering on insane, a little frustrating. Still, being in the party of a contender was a good time. In fact, you may only want to go there if you have someone willing to attempt consuming a mountain of meat.\\n\\nThe BBQ Chicken Salad was zesty, but I think it is tough to mess up anything coated in BBQ sauce.	11	5	6

But, here goes.\\n\\nThe food just is not good.  It\\'s all siting in a vat of oil, and it\\'s a weird mix of who knows what.  Almost every single vegetable was coated in cheese. I mean, I  like cheese, probably even more than the average person, but there are certainly better ways to prepare vegetables.\\n\\nEven the breads were not that good, stale, and I couldn\\'t even find the butter.\\n\\nThere were not any \\'make your own\\' type stations - pasta, omlette - and the carver had duck and ham (where\\'s the prime rib?).\\n\\nThe only upside was the soft serve ice cream machine - can never go wrong with soft serve with hot fudge and sprinkles.	7	0	0

But that\\'s on me. Loud pop music and the whole restaurant was relatively small. They have small upstairs lounge so I suppose that could make up for it. The food was good but the main problem and the real reason behind my rating is the wait time! Do not come to this restaurant if you have somewhere to be afterwards. We started by ordering drinks. 15 minutes later we ordered appetizers. About 15 minutes later they brought our appetizers and we ordered the entreé. 20 minutes later they. Rought the entreé. And then 10 minutes later they brought the drinks we ordered (remember those?) after we were done we asked for a to go box which took about another 10 minutes. And then we waited about 25 minutes for them to bring the check! All in all we were probably in this restaurant 2 extra hours that we didn\\'t need to be. I don\\'t plan on coming back any time soon.	2	0	0

We always used to look forward to going here while in Vegas but will never go again. \\nWhen we went we were seated straight away even though the entire top section of the restaurant was closed which was unusual for this location. \\nAfter asking for the enchiladas with \\"no sliced up peppers or onions on top but sauces would be totally fine\\" we received a plate with plain white rice, 3 flour tortillas and some plain unseasoned chicken breast. No tomatillo sauce or salsa at all. When we sent it back the restaurant manager came back 20 min later, mumbled something under his breath and slammed down the same meal, cold with some tomatillo sauce thrown on top. \\nProbably the worst restaurant experience I\\'ve ever had.

Maybe it was my blonde hair and blue eyes or my friend\\'s biceps that caught her off guard. Either way I felt discriminated against. Not a good feeling. \\n\\n#2. The Pho broth- Well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to Pros. The broth tasted dirty and just off which are usually a sign of a dirty kitchen.....\\n\\n#3. The meat in the Pho- Where\\'s the beef? There were 3 pieces of beef. Nuff said. \\n\\n#4. Our order came out REALLY wrong. We both ordered Pho Tai and one of us was the lucky recipient of tripe.

When I go to a Vegas buffet, I expect a top-of-the-line buffet for $29.95, not a knockoff of the Hometown Buffet.\\n\\nThe selection here was rather minimal. They had a dessert bar, a taco bar, prime rib, a salad bar, and a seafood bar. Nothing out of the ordinary in terms of selection or taste.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping me from giving this the dreaded one-star review were the crab legs. Oh sweet baby Jesus, they were amazing. They were pre-sliced, so you didn\\'t need a hammer to crack it open. If you\\'ve never had crab legs, they are heavenly. It\\'s so easy to eat a few dozen because they are that good.\\n\\nAs much as I Ioved the crab legs, I still felt like the MGM Grand\\'s buffet wasn\\'t as grand as some of the other buffets on The Strip -- or even off The Strip. I felt like I just threw away $30, to be completely honest. Never again.	0	0	0

The broth was so deep and rich that you could taste the hours of preparation and simmering. The Tomato and Burrata dish was fine, as was the Ribeye Steak we ordered.

WHEEE! I\\'m crazy! It\\'s madness. Don\\'t you know I\\'m loco.\\nOk so this place is your signature fast food asian bowl joint. Guest starring Teriyaki Chicken and Beef. I usually get the spicy chicken. The portions are decent and food is pretty fresh. I like the flavors they use from fresh ingredients. This place is cool if you\\'re dieting too! They have a low carb menu: where you can have Brown Rice instead of White. You can substitute stuff like Noodles instead of rice, Fried rice instead of white, Stir-Fry veggies instead of rice/salad, White meat instead of dark, etc...So yea ok I don\\'t consider this fast food because it\\'s not really processed!

It was a bowl of frozen and rotten tasting red mess. There were literally three calamari rings and four tentacles with firm old tofu and rotten tasting kimchi (rotten not fermented). The bowl was full of what they called fishcakes, but it resembled Styrofoam popcorn packing material and tasted like gooey dough. The dry white rice was served on a large white plastic plate on the side. I ate a quarter the dish and had to stop because I started having a stomach ache. The one star is for the attentive service by the servers. Definitely not coming back.	0	0	0

Their Okinawa ice coffee is delicious as well.\\n\\nHeads up they also sell hot pot and brick toast. In case you may wonder, brick toast and honey toast are two different things. Brick honey toast is just the slice of bread versus the whole loaf of bread in a honey toast. Seats here are sparse ( still more seats than Kung fu tea thank goodness!) \\n\\nIt gets a bit busier at night and there\\'s hardly parking out in the lot so be aware as I\\'ve been here at 10 and they\\'ve run out of boba before...horrific I know! Also make sure to get a punch card. \\n\\nTheir \\"normal\\" size is pretty big AND they have light bulb cups for an additional 99 cents now!!!!!! So cute!	1	1	1

It\\'s a small family owned restaurant inside a Indian grocery store with delicious food ..\\n\\nService is definitely very casual and you may end up standing a counter without no one attending you for minutes but it\\'s all worth the wait if you solely concentrate on the tasty food ..\\n\\nTry the thali, it\\'s reasonably priced with good option .. In the end, don\\'t forget to try the complimentary free Chai (Tea) ..\\n\\nOwner - Rani Aunty is the reason we keep going there, the way she takes care of customers & serves food is awesome .. Last time, when we were there, there was no Tea and I asked the girl at Counter and she said that yes we are out of it & no plans to make it again today .. When Aunty came & I was talking to her & casually said to her that we always come & get the tea but you guys are out of it today .. She was like, let me get it prepared right away & Viloa - we have freshly made Tea in 10 mins :)\\n\\nRegular customer here & will always be until the Tasty food is maintained ..!	1	0	0

It wasn\\'t the food that brought my attention, it was her honestly. My fiancé had a good laughter and enjoyed their AYCE menu. The ambiance really brought some memories of my parents hometown in the Philippines with the decor . Very much worth the money and trip. Only thing I wished they did was turn up the AC because the pho got me sweating you know. But overall thank you so much for the overall experience and joy I had during my first visit. Definitely a must!!	0	0	0

Nice music(new and old), great ambiance, and the rooftop view was really nice. The kids did their basic thing and ordered a burger. We shared the mac n cheese egg rolls along with loaded tater tots. I was surprised at how good the egg rolls were, REALLY good! The mac n cheese wasn\\'t your grandmas but it wasn\\'t Kraft box Mac n cheese either. The tater tots were LOADED and very flavorful. The only thing they were just warm, not hot like you would expect straight from the kitchen. I didn\\'t want to complain about that and that will not keep us from coming back. In fact this is on our pitstop list of places to go when we visit in a couple of months. Again the vibe of this place is FANTASTIC!!	3	1	0

Also tried the berry banana smoothie and it was great, delicious the price was $8-$9 for a 21 oz type of size cup so it\\'s a little pricey here I mean you are in the MGM so expect it.

We were one of 2 tables in the place.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was a lackluster experience. Table for four, including 2 kids. We were seated and not given any menus for over 5 minutes. Any mother knows with little ones, service must be efficient as kids do not tolerate long waiting times. The waitress dropped off the menus and ran off. She came back and wanted our food order. When we told her we were still thinking, she immediately ran off without even giving me a breath to tell her our drink order.  She brought our drinks but forgot one. We gave her our food order and sat. We ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. That came to the table. It was a big platter of tempura but accompanied by the most tasteless dipping sauce. Plus, they only serve it with the tiniest amount considering the dish it was paired with. I also ordered a cucumber salad but never received it so I cannot comment on what it tasted like.  Next we ordered 2 chicken ramen noodles for the entrees. Those arrived and were huge. The broth had no flavor and the chicken was cold. It had clearly just been sliced up and thrown in. It too had no flavor. I thought it would be grilled or marinated or something. Definitely not worth the $9 price, even Top Ramen tastes better. My kids had a veggie noodle dish. I give her credit for getting that out to us quickly, but she did not give them any utensils.\\n\\nBottom line, horrible service with nothing to excuse it e.g being busy or understaffed. And blah food. \\n\\nNext time we will stick with our usual sushi joint down the road.	2	1	0

I was wrong.\\n\\nPluses: Not many. Smaller selection of beer than expected. Great ceramic red solo cups and plates. Good soft pretzels. \\n\\nMinuses: Beer selection is mainly dark or Amber beers. Super hot up on the roof even at night. The cool air Misters blow right up into the air. Totally useless. The view of the Bellagio fountains? Non existent through shrubbery. Waitstaff was less than pleasant. \\n\\nAll in all, save your money. Drink for free in the casino.	1	3	0

I\\'d only ever been for brunch, and the brunch was amazing so I figured dinner would also be. I was wrong. For starters, the place is in dire need of a facelift or some sprucing up. The service was so slow that after we had our entrees we didn\\'t see our server for almost an hour! I had to flag down another server to find her. I think they need a dress code, because the clientele was rough for the most part. A lot of flip flop wearing, tank top sporting overly served people without basic dining manners. For these prices, you want a fine dining experience, or you would hit the buffet for dinner instead. I will say, the popovers were delicious, and the filet was cooked perfectly. If the service and ambiance had been even a smidge better, I would have gone back. We will not be back.	2	1	1

I mean that this is not your traditional Spanish Tapas restaurant, as they do have some novel creations by the executive chef/owner, such as this phenom sashimi dish, but that doesn\\'t take away from the fact that I have now found my favorite Tapas restaurant in the US. The food was delectable, and well worth the 8 minute drive out of the strip. I believe the owner said the restaurant has been open for just a few months... and boy what a welcomed addition to the epicurean elite!\\n\\nMy group had at least 15 different dishes served all night, and as full as I was... I just could not stop eating. The lamb chops, super tender calamari, scrumptious lobster n\\' crab, the carpaccio, Tortilla Espanol (which even our Basque friend said was spectacular), and this amazing grilled romaine dish (yes... I said Romaine lettuce... NOT what you expect and a MUST ORDER!!)...... my mouth is watering just thinking about it... all the way to dessert (you MUST try the truffles with lychee vodka). The only thing I did not enjoy was the ceviche.... but that was probably because I just don\\'t like ceviche in general, so I can\\'t be relied upon for comparison on this.\\n\\nIn Las Vegas, this is only the 2nd restaurant in my 20 years of coming regularly that I\\'ve dined in that is on my MUST DINE list on each and every subsequent visit to Sin City (the other being Kraftsteak in MGM... their Platinum cut Kobe steak....!!!). Firefly is good.... but this place..... a class in and of itself. \\n\\nOh... and VALUE!!!!! Price AND quality? Huge fan here..... and I hope they don\\'t change a thing.	4	2	3

Better than any buffet from my home town.  \\nThe wait staff were very friendly and helpful. At the end of the day, its a buffet, the food is never five star, thats the point.  But the food IMO was a solid three and a half, but the desert was an easy four stars and the staff was four stars as well.  That is why this place is getting four stars.  But if we could, it would be a 3.66 lol.	3	1	1

Good food (6-course meal for a reasonable price) and belly dancing, what more could you ask for?\\n\\nI love the interior - it\\'s like you\\'re in a tent.  So cozy.  Your dinner starts by washing your hands in fragrant rose water.  From the prix fixe menu you get shrimp scampi with bread, harira soup (lentil), hummus with veggies and olives, beef kabobs,  cornish hen with couscous and b\\'stilla with mint tea.\\n\\nThey have about 3 belly dancers per night.  The best one is the brunette with long wavy hair (Aradia is her name) - she\\'s the one on their business card and she can do things with her belly I did not imagine could be possible!  She can make beads hanging from her outfit on her upper stomach shake/vibrate.  And I\\'m like, \\"how\\'d you do that???\\"\\n\\nI recommend making reservations as they tend to get pretty busy especially on weekends.  Be prepared to belly dance.  If you\\'re really tall, your back and knees might hurt as seats are pretty low.  Get ready for a fun night!	1	0	0

At the time, my son had yet to outgrow his milk protein and soy protein intolerance/allergy. Which makes eating out something of a challenge for us. Fortunately, Smashburger has an extensive and informative food allergy menu/guide on their website, and the create your own option allows me to easily get a burger free of allergens to share with my son. \\n\\nThe food here is really good too. We love their burgers, and the Smash fries. I was sad to learn though that it\\'s not just seasonings and olive oil on the fries though. Their website indicates that there is soy in the seasoning, and my son did have a slight reaction after eating them.	0	0	0

First of all, the prices are waaaaay high for what you get and the quality. We pulled up to the drive thru (only 1 car parked outside, dining in) and no one in the drive thru. We were asked to \\"hold on a sec\\" - after about 3min my husband said \\"hello?\\" and we were asked to \\"hold on a sec\\" again...after 5 min we were asked if we were ready to order...ummm, yeah. We order and pulled ahead where the girl at the window stuck her hand out for the money, no hello, no nothin\\'. She gave us the change and said sorry for the wait, it will be a bit for your food. So we waited, and waited and watched a table of 4 inside wait and wait and then get their food. Then, we watched them eat. Ok...started to get annoying at this point, yes I could see them cooking the burgers on a grill so they are freshly cooked but come on! At last...22 min after pulling up to the menu board, we receive our food, where she once again says \\"sorry for the wait\\". We drive home (3min away). And unveil....well take a look at the photos I posted. Yikes! My husband\\'s burger Camaro Cheeseburger (2 patties) $5.49 he got with ketchup, mayo, tomato, lettuce was alright, just alright but super sloppy! (You have the option to order mustard, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion & grilled onion, all free). My burger, the Mustang cheese burger $3.99 (single patty) with ketchup, mayo, pickle, & tomato was bleck. Totally overcooked and black. I even got free black \\"crunchies\\" in wrapped up with my burger - see photo. Totally sloppy! We got a chili dog to share/try instead of fries, cause we thought maybe it will be good and wanted to know in case we come back (which won\\'t be happening) since it was they same price to order plain ole\\' fries. It was slopped all over the paper, hardly any chili, little squirt of liquid cheese, and what there was of it was all over the paper, again see photo! It was alright, not good, alright. I cannot, I repeat, cannot believe it is $3.29 for this!!!! It is small, the same dog as weinerschnitzel for $.99 Cents!!! Total for our order: $13.80. Price it was worth: $7.50.\\n I am sad, I really was hoping for something good here that we would go back to since it is close to us. Oh well. I definitely do not see this places hanging around for long. Sorry to the people who were behind us in the drive thru....hope you aren\\'t still there waiting for your order.	8	5	5

Outdoor seating is located in front and part of the back seating is open as well. Take out is offered thru a window in the front outdoor seating area. \\n\\nThe food is really good.

Tucked in the back of the Inn-Zone gaming bar off US-95 and Rainbow, Hemant serves up authentic Kerala street food. \\n\\nHaving lived in Singapore for some time, I was taken right back to Serangoon Road when I tasted the curry leaf in the Kappa and Konj. Beautifully spiced prawns on a bed of creamy mashed tapioca. Loved the heat! Probably the highlight of the meal.\\n\\nMasala chicken chunks perfectly seasoned and tender with basmati rice = a classic biriyani (served in a clay pot added much appreciated presentation). \\n\\nThough not often pointed out by most diners - I love when a chef executes a perfect, simple salad. A light ponzu dressing of hand selected lettuces, elegantly seasoned with picked red onions.\\n\\nHemant is a consummate professional, executing top notch cuisine. His unique expression of regional Indian cooking is informative, inspiring, and give us a taste of India far beyond butter chicken, dahl, and naan.	5	1	2

I walked into a nice greeting and was seated at a small table to look at the menu even though I knew what I was going to order.  I  contemplated the lobster ramen but needed to stay with what I know to give it a full and complete review.\\n\\nA short back story, I have traveled to Japan and fell in love with Ramen I craved it upon my return to the US to the point of driving to LA to have it.  Yes, there was a Pre Ramen day here in Vegas not so long ago.  I do not consider myself a professional I am however a lover and a budding connoisseur of ramen.\\n\\nI had to order the ramen I fell in love with in Japan, Tonkotsu Ramen (pork bone broth).  Tonkotsu is a think broth from boiling bones at a high heat for many hours the soup has a consistency of almost a gravy.  Ramen is an art of sorts if you appreciate ramen almost as much as fine art when it is done properly and consistently in its many different forms.  Only certain chefs really do it right only a few succeed at it correctly.\\n\\nThis was done right it had an amazing thick rich and flavorful broth a nice firm but not too firm noodle you can choose all your favorite toppings to add as well (mine are nori (seaweed), corn and egg)  The egg here is different from what I have had here in the US this is more reminiscent of what I had in Japan.  It is kind of like a soft boiled egg but the yolk remains just slightly soft on the edge of turning firm.  OMG LOVE this once you swirl it around in your soup a bit it warms and oh pure yumminess ensues!  For the softer egg fans only if it freaks you out get a firm one but I suggest trying it at least once.  BTW the Charsu here is different as well, still soft and fatty bursting with flavor but I felt like it may have been cooked differently it had almost a grilled flavor not what I have experienced before but I loved it.  I need to do more research...\\n\\nThe service was nice they served a medium size pitcher of ice water and check on you but leave you alone for the most part but ready to jump when you are ready.  When I asked for my bill I sadly expressed my left overs going to waste it was just too good for me to want to leave behind.  She brought out 2 containers and slowly started to scoop out my broth into one container then added my noodles and what not to the other.  Handed it to me and said \\"there now the noodles won\\'t dissolve and you can eat the rest.\\"  DUH seriously why didn\\'t I think of that!  BTW my lunch the next day was almost as amazing as the prior day! ;)	4	1	2

Good evening snack if you don\\'t want to hit up a restaurant but you\\'re craving something after, let\\'s say, Cirque du Soleil. \\n\\nFor $10, you get any number of crepe or Belgian waffle options. An extra buck gives you savory breakfast choices that are definitely more on the health-conscious side. Lots of fruit, toppings, and sauce options. I like the Versaille - strawberries and bananas with chocolate drizzle (truth be told, they kind of over-do it on the drizzle). I asked for no whipped cream and just a little powdered sugar and got.....tons of powdered sugar and lots of whipped cream. Alas. The crepe - while not the finest I\\'ve ever had in my life - was nice and filling. \\n\\nThe lines get crazy here around lunch time so if you want to experience it, better to go mid-morning or afternoon (or late-night!). Food is prepared pretty swiftly.	0	0	0

I was honored once again to dine at one of his fine establishments.\\n\\nDining at Joel Rubuchon just last month, it really upsets me that I paid 5x as much for a meal I didn\\'t enjoy as much.  The signature tasting menu for $115 was incredible.  The six courses will not leave you disappointed nor hungry at the end.\\n\\nDishes included:\\n- Caviar parfait included a base of shallot-potato cake, Alder wood smoked salmon, creme fraiche, topped with, of course caviar.  I\\'m not a real caviar fan but this was exquisite.\\n\\n- Ahi tuna tartare is basically a Hawaiian poke.  Fresh ahi mixed with sesame oil.  Pine nuts and fresh pear was a nice twist to hawaii\\'s poke.\\n\\n- Chilean sea bass.  For those of you familiar with miso black cod or butterfish, this was a nice take on this loved dish.  It was flakey with a great miso flavor hinted with a smokey taste.  It included a wonton in a lightly salted soup base.\\n\\n- Lobster pot pie.  This was the mini version of his famous pot pie.  Nice large chunks of lobster, mini carrots, potatoes and onion.  It was cover in a light flakey crust which the cut off table side.  The sauce was a bisque-like flavor, creamy and delicious.\\n\\n- Wagyu ribeye.  Perfectly season ribeye cooked to medrare perfection.  The HV foie gras put this simple protein, over the edge.\\n\\n- Dessert - you finally end the magnificent meal with a Trio of simple American favorites.  A peanut butter chocolate bar, a chocolate chip cookie and a mini root beer float.\\n\\nI honestly never had a tasting menu in which in truly loved ALL the dishes.  This was the Exception.  The restaurant was smaller then I expected, which made it more intimate.  \\n\\nService was top notch.  We are fast eaters so usually with fine dining tasting menus there can be a long wait between dishes.  Not here, they immediately caught on to the pace we ate our dishes and the next dishes took no more than a few minutes.  A nice touch.\\n\\nThis establishment deserves more than one Michelin star.  I believe I have found my new favorite restaurant in LV.  This was a great way to start off this Vegas trip.  The restaurants I visits in the next four days will have a very tough act to follow.	9	5	7

Came here twice in 2 days cause it was legit. Why is it legit you ask?\\n\\n1. It\\'s not as expensive as other over-hyped buffets \\n2. The wait is never too long. \\n\\nThey have:\\n- salads and greens \\n- hot food (pizza, mac&cheese, asian noodles, chicken, ok the standard buffet food options)\\n- fruits section\\n- pastries section with toaster to toast your ish (muffins, scones, bagels, etc)\\n- small selection of sushi\\n- mexican-style food section\\n- omelettes made on-order\\n- grilled meat section\\n- for brunch they had the whole waffles, pancakes, and all that section\\n- They have a separate dessert area which isn\\'t too extravagant but its doable\\n\\nYou can choose between soda, champagne, or mimosas with no extra charge. (the mimosas weren\\'t that great though)\\n\\nOverall I would definitely come here again!	3	4	2

First thought when passing by, I thought the business was closed, or was still in renovation. I always judge a place based on the smell of the food cooking. First thing I smelled was adobo and lechon. From there I had high expectations, well of course putting into consideration of fellow yelpers.\\nI had ordered the palabok. The first thing I noticed was that it was tasting burnt. Seems like they left the sauce in the saucepan too long. The noodles and meat were fine but the sauce had a burnt taste that overcame the dish.\\nBut after a disappointing start, the main dish came out. I ordered the pork sisig. Meat was carefully marinated and the green onions and sauce was a great medley. Even tho their palabok was not to die for, their pork sisig made up for it very much. Next time if I do come back to this place I would just get a Pork Sisig to go.	1	4	2

When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you\\'re inside a European gallery. \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \\n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you\\'re into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \\n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I\\'ve had. \\n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn\\'t expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that\\'s was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \\n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \\n\\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.	2	1	1

The salad bar is great, all the vegetables are organic and while I\\'ve seen bigger salad bars, there is enough variety to keep it interesting. A trip to the salad bar will get you good red pepper humus (though that can sometimes separate a bit on really hot days), crackers and muffins as well. There are entrees for everyone. I love the baked potatoes (they\\'re huge) and there are sandwiches, soups, wraps, and a variety of seasonal dishes. The staff is friendly, the food is great and every purchase gets you free soft serve icecream (not going to lie, sometimes I eat that while waiting for my food). Wait times are usually short, and they even deliver!	0	0	0

I abso-freakin-lutely love this show so you can imagine how stoked I was to find this place. \\n\\nNothing else mattered at that moment... I had to try it!\\n\\nI went there twice and loved it both times. The First time was for dinner (and dessert as well merci beaucoup!) - I had their kobe burger w/ fries and it was pretty good. For dessert, I had their original cheesecake w/ Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream topping.... So good!\\n\\nThe second I went was in sometime in the morning and all I wanted was another cheesecake so I sat down and said to the waiter: \\"Cheesecake please..\\" He recommended the Vanilla Bean cheesecake so I went with that and it was amazing!\\n\\nI wish we had one in Melbourne.. I really like it - the staff are very nice, I like the setup (nothing too formal nor too casual). It\\'s a great place to chill and the price is quite reasonable too... I highly recommend it.	1	0	1

The workers were generally cordial, service was very slow and the prices were way too high for food that was average at best. A glass of Orange juice is $5.25. Now for a little story...the second morning my glass of Orange Juice was warm, so I asked for another glass that was cold.  The waitress told me she wasn\\'t supposed to bring me another juice but offered me ice so I could make it cold (and watered down). I explained that my OJ was cold the morning before, so why couldn\\'t I have it the same way today. She relented and brought me another one, but my goodness, I shouldn\\'t have to fight for cold OJ when I\\'m paying almost as much as a cocktail for it!	0	0	0

Unfortunately, it closed but let me tell you that it lives on at Michael Mina in Vegas. Unfortunately, I am not knowledgable about which restaurant came first but I would say I have found my favorite fine dining chef. We got the tasting menu and it was orgasmic. It has everything I love in fine dining: caviar, tuna tartare, chilean sea bass, lobster pot pie, ribeye, and dessert. The service was great and everyone was very nice.	0	0	0

They even give you the option of beef broth or veggie broth. The veggie broth is so tasty.. 5 stars!\\n\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n\\n\\nThe customer service here is amazing. Our server accommodated to all of my party\\'s needs, whether it was to personalize an order or to split checks. I loved how he always said \\"you got it\\" in response to our request. \\nOn top of the great service, the Thai iced tea here is delicious! It\\'s not too strong, too sweet or too creamy. It was just right on this hot summers night. \\nI am vegetarian and could not find any veggie pho. However, our server happily agreed to my request of pho with veggies.\\n\\nAdditionally (seriously, the positive things just don\\'t end), my party of 10 people stayed 30 minutes after the restaurant closed to finish our food. Even though it was after hours, when my boyfriend asked for a banh mi sandwich to go, they did not turn us down even when the kitchen is supposed to be closed.\\n\\nBTW: make sure you check in on Yelp when you eat here! You get free egg rolls :)\\n\\nI really wish there was a pho place like this back in California with such great service.	2	0	1

But, seemingly every time I walk in and ask for Arrogant Bastard they never have any. Happened on more than one occasion and it kinda makes me irritated that I have to drink something that I don\\'t want. The staff and bartenders are friendly and their sweet potato fries are amazing and a must have with your beer.  The Veggie Burger is actually pretty good as well but a bit pricey in my opinion. They also have pool tables, numerous amounts of TVs, and video poker available.  I\\'ve never won on the video poker but maybe I just have bad luck when I play there haha. Fights have broken out on more than one occasion while I was there but it\\'s a bar so whaddya expect? Good bar just don\\'t come expecting a beer that might not be there even though it\\'s advertised outside.	6	3	2

We came in during a slow time and the person who came up after a few minutes to seat us appeared visibly frazzled. No biggie. As we walked to our table the aisle was visibly dirty with food on the ground. We sat for a little longer than average before anyone came to take our drink orders. The service was pretty slow overall. I had to get up twice to ask for refills because A) The cups are TINY! B) I\\'m a drink guzzler. C) Waitress didn\\'t seem too attentive with refills.\\nOverall I would say a few kinks probably need to be worked out service-wise. The food wasn\\'t bad, it also wasn\\'t anything above average. If they don\\'t plan on upgrading the beverage cup sizes, they should emphasize attentiveness on refills.	0	0	0

When I said the cookies were the best I\\'ve ever had, he gave me a whole bag to bring home! Thank you! \\n\\nNote: Added one extra star for the service!\\n\\nFood: Since it was my first time here, I ordered signature tasting, $128 per person. I\\'d recommend it, to try a little of everything. \\n\\n+Sturgeon Caviar Parfait: My favorite! Creamy creme fraiche, crunchy potato cakes, salty caviar with rich salmon, what a perfect combo!\\n\\n+Tartar of Ahi Tuna: a little crunchy, a little spicy, lots of different flavors in one dish. \\n\\n+Crusted Sole: my least favorite. I\\'m not sure why but it just kept reminding me of airplane microwaved food. Even smelled like it. \\n\\n+Lobster Pot Pie: signature dish. Lots of lobster chunks, tasty crust, creamy soup. It was good but not extraordinary. \\n\\n+American Wagyu Ribeye + Foie Gras: Excellent. \\n\\n+Dessert: I don\\'t like desserts that much, so I usually don\\'t care much for it. But for some reason, I couldn\\'t stop eating the cookie! \\n\\nI also did the $88 wine pairing. Totally worth the price. Great selection of wine. My favorites were: Joseph Phelps Cab 2013, Henriot Champagne Rose Brut, Grgich Hills Chardonnay 2015 and Sandeman 20 Tawny Port.	3	1	1

Reminds me of a cross between my local favorites Ruth Chris in Irvine, Ca & Mortons in Santa Ana, Ca. Great service of course, awesome wine selection. Came her for my 40th & knew I was going to have steak so I went with their bone in ribeye & it was definitely not a mistake, no steak sauce necessary & never should need it at a good steak house. I\\'m never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don\\'t see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I\\'ve ever had. I may just have to go against my favorites & get that the next time. All in all this place should be a 5 star but I\\'ve only been there once, I may adjust once I go back again in the new year.	0	0	0

The weather had been great, so we got a seat on the outside patio which was super nice. I love the modern romantic decor with lots of green plants and white garden decorations. \\n\\nThe food was really delicious. I had been to the San Diego location in the past and really liked it there too. The plate setting was presented beautifully along with the food. The drinks are nicely crafted and tasted very good as well. The highlight of our meal was the hazelnut chocolate tart at the very end. Neither of us have a sweet tooth but we both loved this particular dessert. Must order!\\n\\nService was sweet, nice and attentive. Bathrooms are very clean and well designed. Highly recommend!	25	23	25

We were rushed through the line to order the first time. On the first visit, it was one of the least friendly places on our trip to Vegas. But they were redeemed the second time. \\n\\nTzatziki, hummus, pita chips, baguettes, falafel, and chicken over rice all tasted good. The beef salad with all the fixing is delicious. Make sure you use a Groupon discount, $18 for 2x$16 coupons. Then it will be worth it. Without the discount, I think it\\'s a bit expensive with all the great food around Vegas at great prices. Let\\'s hope it stays competitive.	1	0	1

I expected that because every thing on the strip is overpriced.  I know this because I am from here.  This restaurant was not my choice but the ladies I was with insisted on trying this place out. Service was good as well and restaurant is clean.  If you plan to stay on the strip and want to dine at the Aria, Herringbone won\\'t disappoint but if you don\\'t mind heading off the strip, you can pay a reasonable price for delicious food that will satisfy you the same way.	0	0	0

A restaurant with real culture that you don\\'t have to go into a giant Casino & get treated like just another number to see. Marrakech has a glamorous ambiance, top notch food, music, dancers, the whole nine all while maintaining a local appeal.

My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and was hoping to have a fun night because we rarely have time for date nights between our busy schedules. I asked the hostess if we can go sit outside and she said yes and she would send a server out to us. We are very patient people but sat there for more than 30 minutes and no one even came to greet us. We almost walked out until my husband flagged down a server. We stuck it out to make the most of it because it was our anniversary but I don\\'t think we will ever go back again because of the service alone.	0	0	0

Went to get a goblet which was $38 dollars  (which i knew) but you do not get to keep the glass.  You can get a cheap plastic knock off for $15. The drink itself was way to sugary.  Drank the whole thing and no buzz just a headache from sugar overload.  Will not go back.	0	0	0

I usually go to Pho Kim Long on Spring Mountain for my Vegas Pho fix but checked out Kinh Do because it was highly rated on Yelp.\\n\\nThe service was very friendly, attentive, and fast. The restaurant was very clean. The food was authentic. I had the satay hu tieu ($7.99), which was flavorful and spicy. Other people in my group had pho and bun Bo hue. I thought it was pretty good and tasty for Vegas Vietnamese food. My only critique was that there wasn\\'t much meat. The noodle to meat ratio was very high, but prices were reasonable. I would recommend it and come back.	1	0	0

I am very picky about pancakes because our homemade cakes are much better than I can find in a restaurant... But Blueberry Hill makes great flapjacks!\\n\\nThat said, we had to try the strawberry and apple toppings - fortunately we got them on the side... They had a canned taste, they were awful.  I am docking a star for the toppings.  Stick with the Maple syrup!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is like a 50\\'s diner.  They have an impressive menu with specials on display when you walk in the door.  \\n\\nWe will be back next time we are in Vegas!  \\n\\nThis area is a bit inconvenient to get to from the Strip, I also would not recommend going at night...  There were some interesting people wandering around during the day...\\n\\nDefinitely much better than other breakfast / pancake houses places in Las Vegas.  Avoid the fake sugary fruit toppings... They will ruin your breakfast!	0	0	0

I crave this popover!! \\n\\nI order the Shellfish tower for one which includes: \\nHalf Lobster, crab leg, 3 oysters, 3 clams, 2 prawns. Perfect little App before my meal. \\n\\nI ordered the Bone-in Ribeye that comes with bone marrow, roasted garlic and herb butter.

I expected quiet and romantic and it was loud and a bit boisterous. But our seats were cozy and close, so it made conversation easy. Once my expectations readjusted, I had a great time.\\n\\nThe music could be a little lower in volume when the dancers come out, and it could be even lower still in between dancers. But the cozy seating and the method of eating made it all cozy anyway. And...the music was mostly quite awesome!\\n\\nThe scampi was scrumptious, though though would have been completely stellar with a bit less salt. My bf\\'s vegetarian version with mushrooms was a neat idea and worked well.\\n\\nThe lentil soup was some of the best I ever had! In fact, all of the food was really good. \\n\\nThis was a fun night and though I wouldn\\'t eat there all the time, this is definitely  a place to take a group.

I hadn\\'t so I looked at the menu online. Being hungry I just agreed cause the line at in and out was wrapped around the building. When we pulled up to Smash there wasn\\'t a soul in sight. That should have been a sign of something. Dining room was clean and we were greeted promptly and told they would be right with us. There were only 3 tables occupied in the entire building but the staff was flustered and in panic mode trying to run food, answer the phone, and god knows what else. FINALLY we were asked to place out order. Staff was knowledgeable on the menu and offered suggestions and upsells. I ordered a burger for my dog plain but was told about the \\"Fido\\" burger (not on the menu) was told it was a plain burger with no seasoning for $2.00. So I got 2. My friend knew that would cause jealousy at the house so we ordered 3 more for the other pups at home. We each got the sin city burger, hers with no egg. After a SUPER long wait we got our greese soaked paper bags.......... (like REALLY soaked). Got back to the house and began eating. My burger was ok...... nothing remarkable (Double Double animal style is FAR BETTER) Fries were ok but I got the Olive oil and rosemary ones....... the cup they came in had at least 1/4 cup of I guess a mixture of fry greese and olive oil which made me have to throw most of them away. My friends burger had a big ol fried egg on it so she was bummed out. When it came time to dish out the \\"Fido burgers\\" I saw that it was just 5 beef patties in a salad bowl......... that\\'s not what was described. Anyways I guess the lesson is to read the reviews and go where the line is, cause the food and service is probably worth the wait.	0	0	0

Everything from the company, to the food, to the ambiance, to the entertainment was amazing. \\n\\nFirst of all it\\'s off the strip, so you don\\'t have that crazy rush of people coming in and out of the place. It\\'s sort of refreshing, after being surrounded by people 24/7. The place is pretty small, you can probably fit about 50 people in the whole place. So make sure you make a reservation, if you want to get seated right away.\\n\\nOnce you walk in you will notice the great decor. Beautiful bold colors all over the the restaurant, its literally covered top to bottom. The tables/seats are covered in plush cushions, which make you never want to get up from the table.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, everything is on a set menu. It\\'s six courses, the first being shrimp scampi, the second being a tomato based soup, the third being hummus and vegetable platter, the fourth being beef kabobs, the fifth being chicken and couscous, and the sixth and last being a fruit, powdered sugar, filo dough dessert. Everything was family style and amazing. Oh and they really don\\'t give you any silverware, so you have to eat with your hands, good thing they wash your hands with rose water before hand. I really can\\'t tell you which of the six dishes was my favorite, everything had a unique delicious taste. \\n\\nThe other great thing about this restaurant was the entertainment. Every 15 minutes or so a belly dancer would come and dance about two or three songs. The girls are beautiful and it\\'s amazing how they move their bodies. They also interact with the crowd, they encourage people to come up and dance with them. When I was there some of the crowd was getting too happy - they were making it rain on the belly dancers - throwing lots and lots of dollar bills at them. \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back again. I will have to take some belly dancing classes before hand, that way I can dance with the best of them!	0	0	0

My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.\\n\\nFood: \\nOrange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a three year old, I would have maybe enjoyed this.\\nChow Mein: It was a joke. There was chow mein all over the floor and counter. \\nCarne Asada Meat: Dry and no flavor.\\nSteamed Dumplings: This is probably the one thing that I could eat at the buffet that had a decent flavor and texture. I think I ate 6 dumplings.\\nFried Chicken: The batter was overly crispy and the chicken meat was super dry. I couldn\\'t finish it. \\nPasta: There is a pasta bar that reuses the cocktail shrimp. There was nothing that special about it.\\nIce Cream: The ice cream is a soft serve vanilla or chocolate which wasn\\'t that special. It pretty much melts straight up when it lands in your ice cream bowl. \\n\\nService: The ladies here were nice but they also seemed to have the same sentiments that I did in wanting to be at the buffet. \\n\\nAnd to top it all off? I got a nice old stomach ache when I left the buffet and chowed down on some pepto bismol pills to help my stomach process all of the crappy food that I just ate. \\n\\nBottom line: I went here for free but I probably wouldn\\'t come back if you paid me. There is a McDonalds down the street, I\\'d rather dine there and get my $2.22 Big Mac.	3	4	3

The food was AWFUL. They cut the crab legs in half , the meat at the carving station was salty   and just about every other item I tried was either too bland or had a BAD taste. \\n\\nI wish I would have gotten the waiter\\'s name because his service sucked. After being seated he neglected our table for about 15 minutes so we finally flagged someone down to help us then they pointed that the guy who was neglecting our table was our waiter. He came over to our table and acted as if he didn\\'t want to even want to be bothered with us.  I seen other reviews and I ignored them because I tend to find the good in any situation but I\\'m serious when I say I would absolutely never eat here again.	2	5	1

Which makes it roughly 4-8 dollars a person (their prices have been changing) . This buffet has a great salad and fruit bar which is worth if to me. The dishes are all okay and worth it if you have a coupon.  Dessert bar is neat. I always enjoy the cookies and chocolate pie. Main dishes at this buffet arnt my thing so i stick to salad, cottage cheese, and the fruit.  I would go again but not pay full price.	0	0	0

I honestly prefer going to the off the strip locations.  My favorites are the crab wontons, the avocado rolls, chicken taquitos, the lousiana chicken pasta, herb crusted salmon, jamaican shrimp, shrimp scampi, and stuffed chicken tortillas!....The brown bread served is really good as well as their soups.

There was a lot of expectation with Shoku Ramen being the sister store of ever popular (best burger in Las Vegas) Bachi Burger. I was quite impressed after our first visit here and promised myself I would come back. Tonight we had the Bacon Fried Rice for starters, it was unique and tasty. They have two varieties of Spicy Miso, regular and spicy. The regular already had the right amount of heat, any more and it would be bordering on painful and hard to enjoy. We also got the Buta-San which was also good. We enjoy our ramen served with a soft boiled egg extra. The flavors are right on but our only wish is for the pork slices to be cut more thinly. We love the melt-in-your mouth texture of thin and soft chasu like in Fukumimi Ramen or Monta. For dessert, the Black Sesame Ice Cream is always worth getting. Service is good, wait staff is very attentive. Overall, we were very happy with the experience and would be back... unless I\\'m drawn the great burgers next door.	0	0	0

Ordered sisig and some fish balls. Overall, it\\'s ok. Sisig could use some tangy taste to it. Maybe more vinegar or lemon. Also, it was very much full of just pork fat. Maybe I\\'ve been spoiled by Cafe Moda\\'s sisig. Anyway, I also wished the meal comes with more rice. My rice to meat ratio isn\\'t very good, lol. But then again, I\\'m super fatty. I will definitely try again from this place. Trying the bangus sisig next time. I\\'ll update my review if anything changes. I\\'m willing to give them another try.

Especially when paired together. They parallel each other well, each dish complimenting the other. The seafood was fresh and bursting with flavor. My favorite dish was the Domestic Caviar & Butternut Creme for how unique and full of flavor it was. I also loved the Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass for its rich, tasty broth. And who could leave out their signature Lobster Pot Pie? It was thick and creamy with the perfect buttery flavor. I also had one of their drinks that had a cucumber vodka flavor--I cannot recall the name. It was delicious. In general, the wait staff was appropriate and I really appreciated they held our reservation without any problems while my guest was running a little late. The ambiance was elegant yet casual at the same time. You don\\'t have to whisper over your food and are able to really enjoy yourself. Their food is modern and innovative and worth the try. Enjoy!	1	1	1

I had the salmon which was excellent and my girlfriend had the chicken taco wraps which she loved and her hubby had the pulled pork sandwich which he said was good but my poor hubby had the macaroni and cheese hamburger which was not very good. The burger was so dry and the macaroni was not even edible! So disappointed!! We shared two pieces of cheesecake to go and the tab was like $100. Yikes!! Not worth it for not edible hamburger.	1	1	0

The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.\\n\\nI shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree\\'s.  \\n- The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 3 star.  I could have gone to a 5, I\\'m sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there.\\n- The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn\\'t go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it.\\n- My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).\\n\\nThe unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno\\'s.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.\\n\\nI\\'m a fan... I\\'ll go back.	0	0	0

We asked if we could split into two seperate parties to avoid complications as we weren\\'t prepared for this and we were told no. \\n\\nThe manager came up to us as we waited for our table outside and asked us to pick out everything we wanted to order then (rather than at the table where we could discuss as a group with all of our guests) so it started out awkward from there. \\n\\nWe asked how much this would cost and we were told $25 per person. There was enough food brought out for everyone but only a few different options and we continually had to ask for more rice as only 3 (very) tiny containers of sticky rice were brought out for 15 dining guests and curry (that you put over rice) was the majority of what we had gotten. \\n\\nThe server told us that we were only able to seperate the check 4 ways but I have used that POS system and you can split it as many times as wanted. We didn\\'t want the check to be difficult, we were willing to split even ways but having 15 guests for a birthday was really hard to narrow down to 4 different checks. Many of our guests walked across the street to the casino El Cortez to pull out cash as we were trying to not be \\"that table.\\" \\n\\nWhen we received our bill it was over $650. We were charged an 18 percent included gratiuty (I am a 20% tipper but this is actually illegal now in Las Vegas and as a server I would not add my gratuity on such a large party that is already infuriated with me.) when we asked to be charged by individual plates rather than family style as they charged us a $400 family style charge that we were not aware of, they also increased the tip to 20%. I would never think that the server should get the short end of the stick in these situations but frankly he acted as if we were completely annoying for being concerned.	5	1	1

Fellow attorney asked to meet me there for lunch because he is in love with the awesome noodles.  He admitted that they were pretty awesome.  I had the chicken pad thai.  Woo!  Way to break me in.  3 on the spicy scale of 1-5 was SPICY for this white girl.  I loved every minute of it.  \\nWe met there right at 11:30 when they opened.  By the time we left an hour later, there was not any room to sit there.  People were waiting for our table.  This is unheard of for the downtown area.  (It was kinda funny that we ran into his mom there eating with a coworker!  Apparently, he has verbalized his love of the awesome noodles to everyone.) \\nI am interested in returning and sampling more of their menu.	0	1	0

I am addicted to the Iced Mint Green Tea, and usually start with the Tuna Tartare.  For a non-sushi restaurant, it is not surprising to get a bad order of tuna that has been sitting around just a bit too long, but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down.\\n\\nToday I deviated from my usual Garlic Shrimp Pasta, and tried the Enchiladas.  3 nicely done tortillas filled with chicken, and smothered in melted cheese, with a side of beans and cilantro rice.

I\\'ve had it with chicken and shrimp, but I prefer the latter. I also liked the chicken curry which comes with potatoes, carrots and too many onions, but the pad thai was probably the worst I\\'ve ever had. I dont know if maybe because I ordered it with little spice or what, but it was so bland. Their food is super spicy too, on a scale of 1-5 I ordered a 1 and my nose was running. \\n\\nThe lunch special $7.95 and there are about 8 options to choose from. You also get a cup of bland rice soup, an eggroll and a fried wonton. Since this place is close to my work, I\\'ll probably come back when I\\'m in the mood for soup. But I\\'ll likely make the drive a little further for more flavorful food.	2	1	2

The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \\n\\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\\n\\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn\\'t really care for the seasoning either, but that\\'s a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband\\'s rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \\n\\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \\"Emerel\\'s Blend\\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.	0	0	1

To me, it looks like an upscale Hometown Buffet with premium eats.  \\n\\nI bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I\\'m always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.\\n\\nMy buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =D\\n\\nThe food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese. Overall the food was just average and the customer service was on top of it\\'s game. The surroundings weren\\'t fancy or eye catching, just plain boring. No, \\"Wow Factor\\" at all.\\n\\nI expected better from MGM, since it\\'s one of the biggest hotels in the Las Vegas and the world.

Oh but make sure you ask about the price-we found out later it was $13!  It was really great tasting, but seems to me that the price should be $7 or $8.  So for that price shock I am only giving it a three star rating.  We did inquire about the price of the spinach with the waitress but we didn\\'t get anywhere.\\n\\nThe other things we ordered was salt and pepper chicken wings, seafood, tofu and pork hot pot,.  They brought out the soup with beef bone, vegetables and chicken pieces as an appetizer while we were waiting for out food.  It had a lot of depth of flavor which I assume was from the beef bones and warming to the body.  The waitress slopped it on the table when she served us, creating big wet spots on the nice table linen.  They also brought out the desert soup that I believe is made with red mung beans and I very much liked the taste of that.\\n\\nI did enjoy very much the food we had and of course we had plenty to take home to eat later.  \\n\\nI am rating three stars because of the waitress spilling our soup on the table in both bowls and for the high priced $13 garlic spinach.\\n\\nI did very much enjoy the taste and quality of the food itself, so I definitely will be back for another try.	1	1	0

We got there told to sit where ever we wanted too, our orders were taken right away. The nice lady that took our order seemed a little confused on our orders even tho we were not changing anything . We simply picked meals from the menu. We had her come back once than she sent someone else to ask something else she had forgotten to ask. Food arrived quickly. My plate wasn\\'t the one i picked out but it was fairly close and I didn\\'t feel like going back to menu and pointing to the plate that i wanted once more. Our food  was amazing but when we got our bill she overcharged us for one of the plates and one of the drinks we got which was milk.  She was apologetic and fixed right away.  To sum it up things were good besides all the confusion.	1	0	0

Now if you can pack it down like I can. You are sure to get your money\\'s worth with just these few dishes. Although I believe at this price the deserts need to be upgraded. \\n\\nAs far as customer service.

Even though there is so much good food to choose from in Vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    We\\'ve heard a lot of good things about Delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.   \\n\\nFirst things first.  Service was great.   We came late for our reservation.  No problem.   Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\\n\\nThe important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I\\'m paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don\\'t get me wrong, you\\'ll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money\\'s worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico\\'s steaks.\\n\\nThat being said, if you do go to Dominico\\'s, definitely get the sautee\\'d mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!	0	0	0

They serve white rice bowls with various Asian meats and veggies, each with their own light sauce.\\n\\nI ordered the Fried Fish Bowl and for the picky eaters in my house chicken bowls. The dish bowl was really tasty. I really loved the quality of the rice. Nice texture to it and cooked to perfection. The fish was yummy too. Crisp on the outside and soft and hot on the inside.\\n\\nThe chicken bowls came with broccoli and peanuts. My family hates nuts in their food. I tried my husband\\'s chicken and it was very heavily coated in bread and over fried. My husband refused to eat more then a few bites. I finished off his rice. \\n\\nI know Tony wanted to go with something different. I admire him for that. But please take my suggestion to heart- the masses want they are used to. When I go into a rice place I expect to see fried rice on the menu. And there is none. Sad considering it used to be before Tony revamped it. Use your current menu as your specialty menu, but please add more of the normal dishes that Americans are used to. Fried Rice, Brown Rice, White Rice. Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Curry- all that can be added as the topping to the rice bowl. You get the idea.\\n\\nAlso, all the meat is fried. A healthy wok option with Asian veggies is a must. I will come back to give it one more shot in a few months once he has time to see what people are looking for in a rice establishment. As it stands, my husband will never eat here again with their current menu. \\n\\nIt\\'s worth a try if your in the area though. Definitely something different, although not for picky eaters.	2	9	0

I had to add pepper, salt and extra Parmesan cheese for it to finally taste decent.

The atmosphere was pretty loud considering it\\'s in the middle of the casino.   A great cover band was playing, but also just a little loud.  It didn\\'t take away from the meal at all, though.  \\n\\nPricing was very reasonable across the board.  We enjoyed the Red Dragon, Tiger and Sweetheart Rolls which all were very fresh, well prepared and delicious.  We would definitely go back.  \\n\\nAgain, if you\\'re expecting a restaurant atmosphere you won\\'t get it here.  I would give the food 4 stars and the ambiance a 2-3 star rating. .. so overall, I\\'m giving this a 3.5.	2	0	0

This restaurant is located center of Mandalay casino. The menu is limited to primarily sushi with 3 selections for dinner of either eel, chicken teriyaki, or a vegetable curry. The sushi that my friend had didn\\'t state California roll ingredients in it, yet it came out with a California roll inside and topped with ingredients on top as suggested in menu. There wasn\\'t a wait time since area was practically empty around 5:30pm. I will not be going back to this place.

This last time in Vegas, I decided to use Yelp to guide me to a place of deliciousness.\\n\\nMy friends and I stayed on Fremont this time. That deserves it\\'s own review, but I\\'m here to heap some more praise on Le Thai. My experience here was great. It\\'s so busy that they have reservations... I called and was told it would be a 1 hour wait. After giving the lady my number, I immediately received a text and was told I could download an app to see my progress. \\n\\nAbout an hour later, I notice that the app still shows there\\'s a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking to the restaurant and were told they were very busy, and the app was correct. The hostess was very apologetic, but offered our party of four to sit against a bar area. We were hungry, so we agreed.\\n\\nThe service was quick! And our server was very nice and attentive. \\n\\nWe started off with an order of some delicious wings and chicken skewers. The wings were delicious and came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken skewers were delicious as well... Moist, tender, and had a great flavor.\\n\\nFor our main dishes we got the Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry, and Drunken Noodles! The three dishes were so yummy! The level of spiciness that we ordered was spot on. The dishes were delicious and the food came out piping hot. \\n\\nMy only complaints are this...\\n\\n1.) GIVE PEOPLE WHITE RICE with their meals. It\\'s fuckin\\' cheap. You want to mix white rice with your food. Yes, it came with the curry, but that\\'s not enough. DON\\'T BE CHEAP. Your food is already expensive as it is, and it\\'s JUST thai food... \\n\\n2.) PUT SOME FAN/AIR in the back patio. It was like 200 degress back there, and the only thing that kept me from dying was the cold water and cold beer I had. \\n\\nOverall a good thai food place. I would definitely return.	0	0	0

Don\\'t forget to check in so you can get your 2 free cha gio egg rolls, which were hot and crunchy, great wrapped in the greens with mint and the nuoc mam dipping sauce was fine (not as flavorful as our fav place, but fine).  I prefer the leafy green lettuce, but they used romaine.  My usual grilled shrimp w/grilled pork over vermicelli was ok, the pork a little overdone and chunky vs the thinner slices that are so much tender.  Our caramelized short ribs were good.  I don\\'t recommend the clay pot caramelized fish unless you enjoy skimpy portions of fish in overcooked sugar sauce and you like spitting out the bones.  Yelpers gave this place a good rating, but I think 3 stars is generous and it\\'s because the interior was clean and the service friendly.	1	0	0

It\\'s freshly made, but that means a 10 min wait for a egg, cheese and ham toasted breakfast bagel?! I almost finished my coffee by the time the order was ready. This was only 3 customers ahead of me. Imagine what this place would be like at lunchtime?\\n\\nThe service is pretty stern for this hour of the morning, except one lady who made an effort to greet people with a smile and send them on their way. But the lady who handles the order and delivery to customers is fierce!	0	0	0

Went for my birthday, the guest I had and I had the truffle potato chips, amazing. Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Guest got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don\\'t remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg crème brûlée, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that\\'s the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too. So attentive and very nice. Will be coming back here often	0	1	0

Unfortunately, they only do brunch on Saturday and Sunday, so be aware of that. Nevertheless, the food was great. My fiance got their fish tacos and said they were \\"pretty good\\", and I got their whole fish ceviche, and it was absolutely delicious! Definitely try it.\\n\\nAlso, they were SO sweet and gave both me and my fiance our own desserts to celebrate both of our birthdays	0	0	0

Pot of Biriyani was on point, so amazingly good with such fragrant notes that you can smell and taste. Rajah masala was an unexpected treat, crunchy, spicy, exotic. The highlight was that brownie though. A special for the day, soft and gooey with a jackfruit jelly center. To die for!!! The service was excellent too. The girl working behind the counter was knowledgeable about the food and friendly/attentive. We will DEFINITELY be back for more!!!	0	0	0

Exemplary service and an energetic atmosphere - this is what I expected in Vegas dining. We began with the Ahi tartare paired with a lovely Reisling. It wa a perfect combination of buttery tuna, spicy ancho, crunchy pine nuts and refreshing mint. But the lobster pot pie was the ultimate joy. Rich, savory, perfectly balanced truffled brandy cream surrounding an entire lobster, cooked to perfection...and all paired with a delightfully crisp Chardonnay. Oh glorious creation, Perfection is thy name!! Dessert was a pleasant trip down memory lane in the form of a root beer float - unpretentious and delicious.  Michael Mina - you earned those awards, and then some!!!	0	0	0

Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.\\n\\nThe fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.\\n\\nFor a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.com\\n\\nService is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. \\n\\nRandom story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.	10	5	6

There was no line when I went on Hawaiian night. The food was fresh and hot. Everything I had was good. I will go back for the champagne brunch, I will let you know how that is.

We brought our friends from out of town to bring them here because their noodles are really tasty. The six of us get there to a place that\\'s not extremely busy but busy. The hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So we waited. The hostess then asks if it\\'s ok to seat a couple before us and it would not effect our wait time.  Well it did.... \\n\\nBecause she sat some more before us. So our 20 minute wait turned to 45. When we asked the hostess about this she didn\\'t remember seating those people. We complained to her about the situation and how we were upset and she did not care. My wife went to another restaurant Mercadito and asked if they could seat us right away and about are situation..\\n\\nWhile she was doing that I asked for the manager. When the hostess told the manager that I wanted to talk to her she rolled her eyes as I was a bother. As I explained to her the situation and that we were regulars and how we have been treated thus far she did not once apologize. While talking to her she did even look me in the eyes half the time!  She didn\\'t try to make it better she kept telling me she wasn\\'t aware of the situation. She thanked me for my complaint!!  Maybe if she would come out of her office she would know!! So at that time my wife tells me Mercadito will seat us right away and pay for a round of drinks for our trouble!\\n\\nSo the story concludes with we will never be back and that the service is horrible and the manager and hostess should be fired!  If they worked at my business, wait they would never work at my business!	3	2	0

I am admittedly picky about Thai food, so I never get my hopes up. Since this is a new \\"it\\" place downtown there was an hour wait, even at 8:30 on a Friday. So we settled in outside and took advantage of the fantastic people watching. When we first put our names on the list there was a table for 2 open but they immediately put a \\"reserved\\" sign on it. Wouldn\\'t you know that nobody showed up for an hour so we ended up with that table, mildly irritating! \\n\\nOnce we were seated we were immediately brought water. I love me some water so I was really nervous with the tiny glasses they use, but they also bring a carafe so you can refill often. We also got a Thai tea and were pleased with the really large portion. We put in our order for the Thai style wings right away. The wings were fantastic! They were incredibly crispy on the outside and came with a spicy Siracha ranch sauce. I always go for Pad Thai with beef and this was no exception. The Pad Thai was good, but it was very different. It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don\\'t know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting. \\n\\nThe wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read. In my opinion, this is a trendy downtown restaurant so be ready to wait and dine in a noisy hipster environment.	0	0	0

Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife\\'s colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large.\\n\\nMy first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions.\\n\\nAs far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won\\'t be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don\\'t look too closely at their bill.	0	0	0

I ordered a falafel appetizer, hummus, large chicken wrap and steak nachos.  Falafel was excellent, served with some hummus.  Chicken schwarma wrap was very delicious and the hot sauce they serve on it reminds me of the sauce I used to get from the Israeli places in NY.  The steak nachos were nice, except the meat was dried out to literally to a crisp.  As I did not yet taste the meat, my husband was the one who commented on it to me.  I then took my bowl up to the girl and she added less dried out steak, because what I first got was the outer layer and then the less dried out meat was then put in the bowl.  That I found to be very accommodating.  Like another reviewer stated, later in the day the meats on the spits tend to get dried out.  Overall, the food was very good and I will definitely return.	0	0	0

A buddy said he had the best steak in his life here, but unfortunately that wasn\\'t anything close to my experience. Everything we had was sort of meh...\\n\\nStarted with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn\\'t have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\\n\\nMy steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how \\"they cook their steaks\\" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\\n\\nCreamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can\\'t screw up right? It\\'s got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn\\'t even eat half of it.\\n\\nVery disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately. Don\\'t bother.	5	0	0

And this time it wasn\\'t the  exception.  So, I gave this place a try. They literally deserve 3 stars. Everything, including ambiance is MEH. Idk if we were here on a bad day but their employees  seem barely alive to say the least. They have a variety of food, which I gave everything a try and it wasn\\'t horrible but it wasn\\'t good.

I went to the mall with my family this morning and I decided to have breakfast from McDonald\\'s. Finally received my food and went to eat a few bites into my Sausage egg mcmuffin I noticed something didn\\'t taste right so I opened my sandwich to find that my egg was moldy. \\nAt this point I\\'m already feeling a little nauseous just from tasting the moldy egg in my mouth.\\nI walked up to the counter and expressed my concern to the lady and asked for a FULL refund she said okay and called the manager, when the manager approached me she said to me \\"what\\'s the problem\\" in the most rude way you can speak to someone. I grabbed my sandwich and showed her the moldy egg and replied \\"that is my problem, why would you serve this to me\\" because the manager was the person cooking and she goes on to say \\"I didn\\'t cook it, it was already sitting there.....\\" WTF? At this point I am completely pissed off and I couldn\\'t believe what she just said. So as I continue talking to her and telling her \\"so you see it was just sitting there and still you think it\\'s okay to serve me it? Can I please have your name?\\" Instead if giving me her name she decided to tell me to leave and tell me to never come back. She said \\"I have the right to refuse you service\\" at this point I\\'m laughing because she didn\\'t have to refuse me service for me to know that I will NEVER come back to this McDonald\\'s and neither will any of my family members. The thing that got me the most was instead of treating me like I was the problem because my food was moldy she could of just offered me fresh food but instead this is what I got out of it. Typical McDonald\\'s. It is disgusting and there food will most likely cause you to be sick. I have been in contact with the health department due to the fact that a couple hours later I was sick to my stomach. So thank you for that McDonald\\'s and I hope in the future you will train your employees and especially your MANAGERS properly.	0	1	0

I ate at the MGM Grand buffet and spent $85... yet left feeling very ripped off. \\n\\nSeriously two adults was $80 and that price didn\\'t include alcohol. This would have been okay if the buffet had been amazing, but it wasn\\'t. They had one small line of breakfast food that was not above the quality one gets at Denny\\'s for $4.99. Other stuff was dry and/or cold and the selection was meager. They just don\\'t give a crap and obviously this place exists for the people needing to use their comp points. After I walked inside, the first thing I thought to myself was \\"I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE YELPED THIS PLACE FIRST!\\" Als, it was too late.\\n\\nAnyway, lesson learned. If you want food, find another place. I don\\'t care if you just won $100,000, this is not worth it.	1	1	1

Myself & my wife went there two days in a row, while on vacation in Vegas, we were so impressed.  Both visits had great food with large portions & very friendly servers.  Even when busy the order came fast.  The server\\'s are very concerned that you leave happy & satisfied. \\nIn your next visit to Las Vegasbe sure to visit & have a great meal.	0	0	0

Not a fan of the low sitting coffee table seating. Sorry that has to go. Maybe keep a few for cocktail hours but to spend 800$ hunched over, not happening. \\nWe had drinks and they wer all great. The one that is made with bacon was greater than all, it had bacon. \\nOur waiter, Ciprianni, knows the menu backwards and forwards.  He was great at describing and explaining. \\nThe sailboat appetizer was off the chart. Too bad I had to share with others. \\n\\nMain courses were well received.  My only issue was the seafood spaghetti I had was lacking in over all seafood. At that price, I would have kicked more, not just 3 shrimp and some rings of squid. Other than that the patio is where you should eat. \\nMake a reservation and get in.	0	0	0

We had to wait quite a while to get our order in.  Not enough wait staff for volume of customers.  Menu itself was huge.   I settled on the mexican pepper steak.  Meat was kind of flavorless but tender.  Salsa had a nice zing and better than i thought.  Rice was like out of a box and the beans were like out of a can. Flavors were ok.  I had some of my friends rocky road pancakes and it was decent.  Good flavor but texture was lacking.  Overall ok visit but I think there are better breakfast places in Vegas to choose from.	1	0	0

It was my first time in Terminal B at McCarran, and since my flight was not for a while, I decided to venture and try something new. With a name like Great Steak & Potato, I thought of it as some unknown chain, and it probably is, but I decided to give it a shot. I mean, nothing too bad could happen on a one hour flight, right?\\n\\nAnd nothing too bad happened.\\n\\nI opted for the classic cheesesteak, and since I didn\\'t exactly know what Philly cheese was, I was unfortunately greeted with a sandwich with cheese sauce. While I like nacho cheese, I\\'m not too big of a fan of cheese sauce if not done right. It wasn\\'t done right. Personally, I thought I should have gotten the one with provolone, but I am bad with my cheeses, in general.\\n\\nFor the price and the size, about $9 for a 7\\" cheesesteak, it was overall really underwhelming. It was a small shop as well, so seating was quite limited. Customers were literally fighting over that. Not that much fun when I had a flight within minutes.\\n\\nIf I had to go again, I would definitely try the one with provolone. However, to be honest, Jersey Mike\\'s in Terminal B is way better.\\n\\nTIP: N/A	0	0	0

I wasn\\'t expecting my simple entree order of bbq beef skewers with garlic Java rice to come so nicely plated on a banana leaf. It also included a little side of papaya relish (Atsara). And the prices are insanely low for these dishes taken to another level. The elderly lady I held the door for as she went out looked at me and nodded and said Ma Sarap!! That\\'s  good stamp of approval right there! She was right! My meal was really good!\\n \\nNew Owners!\\n\\nThe former bbq  place Full House BBQ has been transformed! It\\'s now Full House BBQ...House of Manila Cuisine. Yes Filipino food with some bbq items thrown in!  Chef Alex and his team is behind all the cooking. He held the executive chef position over at Golden Nugget, but now this is his place along with the new cowners a family who moved here from the PI couple months ago. It\\'s limited menu for now but what they offer tasted awesome! Location Smiths Shopping Center corner of Maryland/Silverardo. Your visual cue Cici\\'s Pizza..Tokyo Discount. It\\'s right between those two places. \\n \\nAlong with my entree, I also ordered:\\n\\nSiopao: (aka steamed pork buns, Manapua) is one of their featured items and made in house!  Breading just  fluffy enough to hold the filling. It\\'s steaming hot when you cut into it, so becareful! The filling is packed with diced bbq pork asado mixed with a sweet hoisin sauce and they give you a little cup of hoisin sauce on the side for dipping too. This really could be a meal itself or a midday snack it\\'s that filling.\\n \\nLumpiang Sariwa: The Lumpia appetizier I ordered  was more like a crepe with fresh wrapper filled with fresh sliced veggies! Loved this! It was topped with diced peanuts and garlic with some type of sweet sauce on the bottom. Hecka good!\\n  \\nMami:  Another specialty of this restaurant and it\\'s advertised as \\"create your own soup\\"  ..Choose a Noodle [thin wonton/rice noodle/wide egg noodle] Choose Your Topping [shrimp&pork wonton/soy chicken/beef stew/meatballs/fishballs] one topping sets you back $4.99! I requested an hard boiled egg to add to mine too. That\\'s my creation ;)  Warning: It comes in a BIG bowl! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were al dente.  The way I like my Mami!\\n \\nTuron: It\\'s glazed w/ jackfruit and brown sugar and filled with sweet banana (Turon) and pieces of jackfruit.\\n \\nEveryone was really friendly, my order(s) came out in a timely manner.For being a new place, it sure was fairly busy! The dining area felt spacious, says it seats 45 ...just go up to counter and they\\'ll seat you if you are dining in.  Or you can order take out too.  Ambiance - felt more hip with the modern interior with clean lines. Even the dishes used are nicer quality.\\n\\nThey are adding more items to the menu. Kare Kare is one of them.\\n \\nSo of course Im giving this place 5 stars right off the bat.  Everything is cooked to order. That alone is a big plus for me.  Also you will surely get more than your monies worth here and leave with a full and happy belly!	38	18	30

We had 6:30 pm reservations and chose to do try the 3-course Sunset Menu. I chose the waygu short rib ravioli, the phyllo- crusted sole and the candy bar dessert. We also ordered truffled polenta and brussel sprouts for the table. The ahi tuna tartare melts in your mouth. Each dish was more fantastic than the next. Make sure to put this on you agenda the next time you are in Vegas.  We left satisfied and raving about everything we tried. I love to dine all over the world and honestly this is one of the best meals I have experienced.	1	0	0

The staff really know how to make newcomers feel very welcome and feel like they care about their customers. The waitresses are very in tune with their tables and interaction with their guests.  The food is good also the portions are enough to usually feed two people. I would recommend them they have a few locations around the area. We visited the one on Durango, it\\'s their newest location and I think it was good and the service is great will go back again for sure. And will bring others to visits there and try their foods!	1	0	0

I went there as just one person and was seated in a booth by myself and was still given excellent service and attention as I would expect. I was expertly consulted by a sommelier on my wine choices to go with my $50 filet that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. All in all I had a $120 five course meal with two glasses of wine. Some may think outrageous, but hey its Vegas and I didn\\'t have a problem splurging a little bit. Enjoy yourself - this is 5 star perfection for service.	0	0	0

For sides we had the cheesy grits and asparagus. LOVED the popovers.\\n\\nThe service was weird... our waiter was knowledgeable and professional but seemed preoccupied, always looking around while talking to us. There was a group at the table next to us and he seemed much more attentive to them. \\n\\nAnother waiter came over at the end of our dinner and we asked what spice was used in the waffle- he said he didn\\'t know. I then asked where The Dorsey was in proximity to the restaurant, he said- again, I don\\'t know........ he didn\\'t even attempt to answer our questions.

This was my Husbands and my first time trying Ethiopean food. We have been talking about it for at least 2yrs so needless to say I was very excited to try this place while we were in Las Vegas. We ordered the Vegetarian Combo and the Kitfo, as well as the puff pastry appetizer that was filled with lentils. EVERYTHING was amazing! The Injera made for an overall great dining experience.  All of the staff was very friendly and attentive. Don\\'t let it\\'s humble outward appearance fool you. If I had to change anything it would be to have cloth napkins and maybe some updated menus. Overall a great first time experience and we will be returning!!!	2	0	1

My friends and I popped in off the street with no reservation and not dressed up at all.

Only reason I\\'m doing this review is because of Delmonico\\'s Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico\\'s and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \\n\\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\\"Damn I\\'m getting jipped out of 15 bucks\\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \\n\\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.	0	0	1

Still a bomb pho place in Vegas tho, especially when in Vegas come hangover tyme.\\n\\nFollowing the recomendation first review I read, by Carly N, I ordered Bun Rieu. I\\'m not Vietnamese, so I can\\'t claim nostalgia for homemade Vietnamese food, but when I think Vegas and I think morning-after meals, I definitely feel a tinge of bitersweet longing for Kinh Do. This is the answer to all your woes.\\n\\nBUN RIEU - I have no native standards to go by, but wow this is an amazing bowl of noodle soup. If you like seafood and noodles and flavor and generous helpings of everything, order bun rieu.\\nEGG ROLLS - some of the best Vietnamese egg rolls I\\'ve had, even if they weren\\'t free. Delectably savory filling wrapped in deep fried crispy layers.  I really appreciate the plate of greens and pickles that came with. Definitely dipped some of that lettuce in my soup, because there is an unfortunate dearth of fresh produce in Sin City menus that leaves me dreaming of salad.\\nBUN BO HUE - decent. Hearty herby spicy and satisfying, but doesn\\'t stand out.\\nPHO - broth is solid. At some point, pho is pho is pho and Kinh Do does pretty good pho.\\nPHO GA - meh. Not impressed.\\nVIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE - nothing special; the coffee is a tad weak for my taste. But when it\\'s 100 degrees out and you\\'re hungover af, cold creamy coffee + a steaming bowl of noodle soup works something magical.	2	1	1

Sent them back, they put the burgers back on the grill. Came back mine was supposed to be medium well was medium. My wife\\'s was supposed to be medium was medium rare. Both came back on blood soaked buns WOW.  We were disappointed. It did get better the pecan pie with ice cream was very good.  Also our server was very nice once he came to the table. So for the poor burger and blood soaked bun I have to give three stars.	1	1	0

More than likely due to the poor seats we had.(avoid the tables next to the entrance. People who have been sweating in the Las Vegas heat all day line up and sit on the rail next to your face while you eat....). Food was as expected...too much but good. It was very hot and humid outside of the restaurant, next time I will ask to be seated inside. Our waiter very good and friendly. Really liked the Avocado Spring Rolls.	1	0	1

My dinner was comped so I didn\\'t have to pay but had I paid, I would have been pretty upset.  Outside of crab legs and maybe shrimp cocktail, the buffet didn\\'t offer anything that I could consider \\'premium.\\'  The seafood was limited and their food was mediocre, at best.  After my initial first round, I didn\\'t find anything that I particularly wanted to go back to get seconds.  I would highly suggest avoiding the sushi as the rolls were most likely previously frozen and not fresh.  They have a station where you can customize your seafood dish and I didn\\'t like the fact that they served swordfish because 1) They\\'re not very good and 2) It\\'s not good for the ecosystem.  I found that most people end up getting swordfish because the only other fish that he can cook is tilapia and that\\'s a cheap & dirty fish.  \\n\\nOverall, a very disappointing experience.  I don\\'t remember MGM Grand Buffet being this bad but it looks like since no one goes to this buffet anymore (i.e. little to no line), they\\'ve also downgraded on the quality of what they serve.	0	1	0

Remember Erik, you didn\\'t eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn\\'t go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\\n\\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao (\\"A nightclub that happens to serve food.\\") and Cut (\\"Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they\\'ve toned it down... the salt, anyway.\\")\\n\\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril\\'s New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\\n\\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don\\'t remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre\\'d butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\\n\\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril\\'s banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \\n\\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.	0	0	0

My wife loves the philly hand rolls and a large bowl of udon noodles.  My daughter loves the tamago rolls and miso soup.\\n\\nThe food here is prepared and served quickly.  The prices are reasonable, which is why I come often.  I call this place a fast, casual restaurant.  The staff is friendly and will do all they can to make sure that you have a good experience.	1	0	0

Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \\n\\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \\n\\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \\n\\nMy friend\\'s side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don\\'t like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c\\'mon.   \\n\\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend\\'s chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\\n\\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don\\'t have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \\n\\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\\n\\nService: As always with Emeril\\'s restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \\n\\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I\\'m glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.	0	0	0

We got seated, but the waitress never came and so the manager actually took our order.  We finally got our food approx. 30 min. later (mind you we only ordered a burger and chicken sandwich). The food finally shows up and then good luck finding the waitress for the check. She was MIA! Again, we got up looking for someone to flag anyone down and no one was around. No cashier, no manager, no waitstaff. \\n\\nAlso keep in mind there were very few people in the restaurant. Unbelievable.   As far as the food goes, it wasn\\'t bad. I\\'d eat there again if they changed the management in there and got a whole new crew to pick up the pace.	2	0	1

I got the Ga Pow with noodles instead of rice and it was the best Thai dish I have ever eaten. The cheapest lunch special in Old Vegas and it comes with a drink!

Was disappointed at first when we were seated upstairs in a small table right next to the kitchen doors where there was foot traffic galore.  We spotted an open booth and they happily moved us.  Thank gosh because it was probably the most awkward place to sit especially on a first date!  Whatever you are looking for, Cheesecake Factory has it.  I become impressed with menus that have options for a lower calorie meal, although 600 calories doesnt seem that low to me!  I ordered the healthy delight salmon with veggies.  I could have finished the entire thing but didn\\'t want to look like a piglet! It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn\\'t your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!  \\nThe wait on a Friday night wasn\\'t long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!	1	0	1

I think I\\'ve found one of my fave boba places!\\n\\nAfter a long night at UNLV, my fiancé and I started to crave boba. We drove to Chewy and was immediately heartbroken to see it closed. We almost went to Tea Time but we didn\\'t wanna deal with bad customer service so we ended up here & thank goodness we did!\\n\\nTea Space is open late & this quaint little place has the friendliest workers. You walk in to a cute well-decorated place. They saw us struggling with choosing from their extensive menu and they were kind enough to give us their milk tea to try out. It was so good that my fiancé ordered himself a large. I wanted something fruity though so I decided on mango black tea with lychee pieces. We also ordered takoyaki cause.. why not.\\n\\nThey brought two super tall glasses of our drinks and takoyaki served on a little pan. So cute! The milk tea is not too sweet and we didn\\'t adjust the sweetness so that\\'s a good thing. It\\'s creamy and the boba is chewy, but not too mushy. I loved my mango black tea too. It\\'s bright, not bitter, very fruity and refreshing. The takoyaki was lightly drizzled with the sauce and topped with a lot of yummy bonito flakes.\\n\\nTea Space is definitely in my top 5 right now!	3	1	1

Because, darnit, the food just wasn\\'t very good. When the best part of the meal is that the diet coke was pretty fizzy, you know it\\'s not worth $30. \\n\\nBut, let\\'s be honest: it was free with our stay at the Signature, and free is good. But DO NOT pay $30 to have dinner here. If it\\'s free, Bon appetit!	2	1	0

For so many reasons. \\n\\nWell, the night started out in Vegas with my parents and sister. We came for a weekend of shows, gambling, and tasty food. The plan was to hit up Michael Mina, then to Cirque du Soleil\\'s \\"O\\" in the Bellagio. On our way to the restaurant, as we walked by the Bellagio fountains, my boyfriend popped out of nowhere and proposed to me. Apparently this was all planned by my co-conspiring family members. \\n\\nAfter many tears and my dad acting like paparazzi, we headed to the restaurant. I have been vegetarian for many years, so my fiance and family decided Michael Mina would be a great restaurant since they have a vegetarian tasting menu. They were SOOO right!\\n\\nThe waitress was super nice, and after we told her that we had just gotten engaged she brought us the champagne list. Obviously. My parents ordered champagne and we had a toast. After we finished the bottle, our waitress brought us the label on a card in a little Michael Mina envelope. We thought that was such a special, thoughtful touch... definitely going in the wedding scrapbook. \\n\\nOK, now onto the food. We all ordered the tasting menu--everyone else ordered the regular, and I got the vegetarian. To start it was the heirloom beet salad with burrata cheese. A very small plate but a great starter. Next it was the best course--the fennel tortellini. SO amazing, made with fennel and citrus brown butter. Next was the Japanese tasting, with rice, crispy tofu, glazed baby bok choy. Ohhhh boy do I love me some Japanese food. Especially tofu done RIGHT. Overall I loved the menu--perfect portion sizes, wonderful flavors. I was also just generally giddy because of the engagement PLUS the vegetarian tasting menu. On a weekend vacation in Vegas with my family and fiance. Pretty much all my dreams in one. \\n\\nFor dessert, they brought out the tasting desserts. Apple cider, brownie, and chocolate bon bons. But the best part of all was the mini root beer floats with sassafrass ice cream. YUM! and so fun. Tasting menus are always fun because you can try so many things without getting completely stuffed. \\n\\nAll in all, loved the food, the service, and the ambiance. A truly wonderful restaurant for a special night. Plus, it is close to \\"O\\" if you are going to that show, which is absolutely mind-blowing. Thanks to Michael Mina for making a special night even better :)	0	0	1

The food tasted like grandma\\'s recipes, and the spice level was definitely kicked up for those of us who like our food as spicy as our life!  The real beer from the orient they have was a nice find.  I was a little worried when I saw some white guys in the kitchen, but grandma must have taught them properly.

For some reason, I find their buffet to be a good value, and call me crazy, but they make a crazy-good tuna salad!! Yes, of all those options (including crawfish-not for me), I return again and again for some of that tuna!  Not the biggest or brightest buffet, but I am still a fan and will return each and every time.	1	1	2

Geno Bernardo is the executive chef of this newly opened restaurant.\\n\\nWe were seated at one of their lounge style chairs and table.  The patio was not yet opened because of the cold weather.  Having lunch that lasted about 3 hours, it got a little tiresome for me leaning forward and reaching down to get food from the coffee table.  I can see for a dinner or some drinks and a little food, this would be fine.  \\n\\nChef Bernardo brought out/sent out several seafood dishes to start the lunch.  After an auspicious start with crostini topped with uni, sea salt, and lardo, we were brought three kinds of oysters and then an oyster shooter. I was impressed by the chef\\'s relating how quickly the oysters were gotten to the restaurant.  The Naked Cowboy shooter with crab and caviar was especially good with the salt of the caviar adding to the flavor of the oyster.\\n\\nAfter this, several seafood dishes were brought from hamachi crudo to escolar sashimi to big eye tuna, and tuna belly.  This was some of the freshest seafood I\\'ve had in Las Vegas.  The dishes were very creative too.  A standout here was the Poke with macadamia nuts, crispy onions, togarashi, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, and Shoju with green onion pancakes.  What a great combination of flavors.  There were other dishes each worthy of mention but I will lack space to name them all.\\n\\nWe then moved to the hot dishes with Thai chicken wings, onion soup, bacon and eggs ravioli, branzino, Grandma\\'s meatballs with pork neck ragu, sea bass tails and belly, and a vegetable medley of carrots, French beans, and broccoli rabe.  I am known for not eating wings.  These are so good and done so well, they\\'re a delight and I\\'d go back solely for them.  The onion soup with its pretzel crouton and gruyere cheese ravioli was also a big winner.  I also have to mention the sea bass tails and belly.  Excellent!\\n\\nMoving on to desserts, we were served Adult Root Beer floats made with Not Your Father\\'s Root Beer (5.9% alcohol) with vanilla bean and cinnamon ice cream.  My float was made with Coke and there were gingersnaps served with the floats.  Along with this we had turtle cheesecake, carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and salted caramel panna cotta. A double espresso over ice was an additional enjoyment to the sweets!\\n\\nService was excellent!  My iced tea glass was constantly replaced with a fresh one and water was added to glasses often.  \\n\\nSome of the items we had are not on the menu but may be when it\\'s finalized--we were trying them out.  \\n\\nHerringbone really adds to the restaurants at Aria.	20	6	9

I have been getting the same order for years! Spicy chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies! I have tried their orange chicken and teriyaki chicken, and most people say that the orange chicken has taken a turn down south. It isn\\'t the same from before, however, this is only coming from someone who has been coming since long ago! \\n\\n*TIP* I would give a call in advance if you know what you are going to get! I only suggest this because, sometimes it could get very busy and you\\'ll end up waiting 10-15 min for your order!	0	0	0

One of the guys we were with had been here before so we came on his recommendation. The drink selection was great. I like beer, but not how I like whisky so I was pleasantly surprised to see a robust scotch collection as well including the Yamazaki 12 and 18 year (no Lagavulin though...) as well as Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Oban, etc. Everyone was happy with their drinks and the food was great as well. I had a steak wrap on the waitress\\' recommendation along with their onion rings. My friend had some buffalo Mac and cheese and I\\'m thinking of going back just to try that!	1	0	0

Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. \\"Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them,\\" I inquired. \\"Yep,\\" was all he said before moving on... didn\\'t even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.\\n\\nThe food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer\\'s market for a fraction of the price. And it\\'s not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you\\'re going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it\\'s not worth it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.	2	1	0

It\\'s a joint restaurant with a burger place, but that didn\\'t take away from the ramen  it literally was the best bowl of ramen I\\'ve had in the states. \\n\\nAs for ambiance: this place is comfy and offers plenty of seating both indoors and outside. \\n\\nService: slow the night I went but my understanding was that they were short staffed...so I give this place a pass on service. Hopefully when I go back I can say it was excellent!!!\\n\\nFood: I chose the Spicy  miso ramen. It didn\\'t disappoint! Generous portions, flavorful and tastebuds tantalizing \\n\\nSo if you\\'re needing to get your ramen fix. Come check this place out. ;)	0	0	0

But the slow service and so-so food really let me down.\\n\\nWe stopped in on a busy Saturday afternoon. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, and the hostess took our cell number and said she\\'d call when our table was ready. (This sounded like a great plan!) So we walked around the Fremont East area for awhile and then returned to the restaurant to have a drink at the bar.\\n\\nWe told the bartender we were still waiting for a table, and he told us the waitress would get us when our table was ready. Not sure what the disconnect was, but we sat at the bar for more than half an hour while people who came in off the street sat down to eat. (Yes, some of them came in after a phone call, but I watched others who just stepped up and immediately got a table.) I figured we were waiting for a table in the small dining area and not a table in the bar area, and that\\'s why we were still waiting. But, no. When our table was ready, it was a table two feet away from us in the bar area. (Why we couldn\\'t have just sat there initially, I don\\'t know.)\\n\\nWe tried to order a bottle of wine while we were waiting, but they were out of our selection. So my husband got a beer and I had a water. When our table was finally ready, we had to cash out at the bar first, which was also kind of annoying. But I still had high hopes, because I had heard the food was great.\\n\\nI love Thai food, and when I go to a new place, I always order shrimp pad thai to gauge it against other restaurants. This one was just so-so, although the portion was large enough that the $15 price tag was somewhat warranted. My husband fared better with his beef short rib fried rice, which I must admit was delicious (and I\\'m not a fan of short ribs). But it took a LONG time to get our food--as well as the beers that we ordered with it--and our waitress never came back to check on us, so we never got to order a second round of drinks like we had intended.\\n\\nAll in all, we spent $50 and an hour and a half for three beers and a mostly forgettable lunch. I hope other diners have a better experience than we did, because the menu showed promise (and the short rib fried rice was nearly worth the wait). But I think next time I\\'ll drive the extra few miles to Lotus of Siam, where I know the food is always excellent, even if I have to wait.	0	0	0

Didn\\'t find it to be not too much or not too flavorful at all. I did go for breakfast so maybe dinner is different but I thought it was an okay buffet. Especially for what you pay for it was only $18 a person which for what you get it\\'s not too bad! You get your own drinks which was different but we also liked it because we didn\\'t feel we had to tip too excessively. Overall it was a decent buffet (again for the price.) Wish it would have included at least one mimosa or something but other than that I don\\'t have a complaint!	0	0	0

I give it 3 stars because the decor is bad, food is average, the host was confusing, Thai tea was way off, they took too long to deliver our food, and prices are too expensive in relation to quality, I got a spice level of 4 out of 5 and it wasn\\'t even spicy at all-I had to add my own spices.

Soup had 5 pieces of tofu in it & not as generous as I thought it would be. (Soup: $10, Spring rolls: $6). I TOTALLY GET WHY THEIR PRICES ARE SO HIGH, since their on the strip, but seriously??? TEN DOLLARS for soup???? I had the same soup, (actually better & BIGGER) in Colorado for ONLY $4. I was HOPING to walk out with a Thai tea as well but I only had $20 so it all went to soup & spring rolls. LOL	0	0	0

On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it about an 8.5.\\n\\nThe Service - Top notch service. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. At no time were we having to wait for something. The hostess was especially nice.\\n\\nThe Environment - Beautiful restaurant, dark and romantic. A little on the noisy side, but nothing that was an issue.\\n\\nThe Appetizers - I had the Spinach Salad which was spectacular and my wife had the Caesar Salad which she said was very good. They also bring you Cheese Popovers that are extraordinary. The popovers even come with a little card that has the recipe. Nice touch. Prior to the popovers, the waiter brought a little taste from the kitchen, which was a duck liver mousse with a jelly topping. The mousse was amazing.\\n\\nThe Entree - I had the Filet, which was cooked perfectly, but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. It was good, but not great. My wife had the Tuna Tartare as her entree and she loved it. She said it was the best she\\'s ever had.\\n\\nThe Drinks - I had a Johnny Walker and Soda and it was STRONG!!!!\\n\\nWe did not have dessert, too full, but the dessert selection was good.\\n\\nOverall the restaurant was very good. I\\'m a big steak fan, but I like bolder flavors, so I would probably not order a steak next time we come, but my wife will definitely order the tuna again.	0	0	0

It was a girl\\'s night out and we were celebrating a birthday.\\n\\nI did not expect a restaurant of this caliber inside of Bally\\'s.

The waiter was real nice and quick. To start off their half shell Kushi Oysters were delicious, the presentation was nice and had a unique taste to their sauce. It was def. fresh and cold just the way i like it. \\n\\nThey hand you a Ipad to order any cocktail drinks and dessert which was cool. It was very well detailed and the pictures was a plus. the cocktail was more on the fruttier side that didn\\'t taste like it had any alcohol at all. \\n\\nTheir Filet Mignon was prepared nicely, small portion but it did fill us up.\\n\\nThey do have photographers walking around snapping pictures and we ended up buying a package lol. She made us pose in different ways and complimented us very well, it also came with a frame. The lady was nice enough to even send the pictures to our room since we didn\\'t have any time left. \\n\\nSadly we had no time for dessert but maybe i will try next time :)	0	0	0

It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent.\\n\\nMy steak was almost reasonable. My buddy\\'s steak next to me (same cut) was left half-finished on the plate (overcooked and just generally not awesome).\\n\\nThe ambience and service was great, but if you can\\'t get the steak right...	1	0	0

I was expecting the food to be WOW memorable, but left with an \\"eh, I\\'ve had better food for that price\\" in my head.\\n\\nThe decor was nice and the food decent, not oh my god I have to get some more. The service seemed distracted and we were so close to another table it almost seemed like we were dining with them. The noise level was quite loud for fine dining. I couldn\\'t even hear my wife talking to me.\\n\\nThe only memorable thing was the tiny tasting of tomato gelee with avocado and shrimp we get for free. Oh wait.. That and the shock of the bill.\\n\\nIf you can make it for the pre show dinner then yes go ($55 for 3 course meal) what the food is actually worth. If not, then I would pass	2	0	1

We came in  a little after the dinner rush and the place was still fairly packed. Waters came quickly but we had to wave someone down to take our order after sitting there with the menus closed for 10 minutes. The server had said he\\'d be right back to take orders when he brought out the water.\\n\\nService: Poor, pretty much non existent after taking our initial order. No check ups or anything after waiting over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My water cup was empty and they did not bring water until after the food arrived. I could\\'ve used a refill during the lull. The servers don\\'t have specific sections so we were receiving overlapping service.\\n\\nFood: Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was bad. Instead of the traditional thin layer of crispy starch, it was deep fried in tempura batter. The ramen Miso and Garlic Oil ramen were decently portioned for the price. I like that they include half an egg and spice for no additional charge. The egg however, is not seasoned and just plain boiled. \\n\\nOverall: Truly it deserves two stars but I\\'ll be nice since they are brand new and still going through growing pains. We\\'re still thankful for a Ramen shop near home and will be back!	0	0	0

I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever encountered such a generously portioned tasting menu and everything from the amuse bouche to dessert was excellent. The two dishes that stuck out were of course the lobster pot pie as well as the foie gras that was close to the size of a sirloin steak. The lobster was very fresh and tangy and the pie crust was phenomenal, flaky to the point where it melts in your mouth. I would suggest patrons to sit at the bar because you can still receive the full menu and share a lobster pot pie as well as the foie gras. Service was fine but I\\'ve experienced better at restaurants similar to Michael Mina. The interior reminded me of a nice steakhouse and didn\\'t incorporate a lot of modern or contemporary elements.	0	0	0

We sat at a casual cute outdoor lounge with coffee tables.

They don\\'t take reservations and we had a party of 13.  They gave us the runaround for at least 1.5hrs regarding when we\\'d be seated.  We tried to kill time in the mall but it truly was a painful wait.  It was moderately frustrating to watch people show up, eat a meal and leave.\\n\\nAside from this, everything else was great.  The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is massive and I had second meal with my leftovers.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake is tart and delicious.  I wasn\\'t expecting the crust to include coconut.  I do think they add waaaay too much whipped cream to the plate.  Most people who had desert hardly touched it and it seems like a huge waste.     \\n\\nOur server was friendly and swift.  I don\\'t know if this is normal because they may have been kissing our butt due to the seating issue.  Either way, the experience once we sat down was lovely and I\\'d definitely return, with a much smaller group this time.  I wouldn\\'t go back with a party larger than 4 or 6.	0	1	0

Come here if you enjoy an overpriced burnt, bland and tiny dinner. Their steaks were the most disappointing. While it came out on a cast iron skillet, it did NOT sizzle with the usual amazing butter aroma. Instead, the bone-in strip AND filet mignon were room temperature and tasteless. It was the toughest piece of \\"prime\\" meat I have ever had. Even worse, while cutting into it, you did not get that juicy pink center.... instead we got a very dry brownish pewter color. Signs that it was a very old cut of meat and maybe should\\'ve been thrown out. We wasted a dining experience here and I felt responsible for taking my party here. Coming from California, I felt defeated for not being able to source a better place to dine. With only one night left in Vegas, I will have to knock it out if the park tomorrow night.	0	0	0

I don\\'t visit Las Vegas very often and was expecting the Buffett to be very expensive but at only $26 per person on Saturday morning I feel that we got an incredible value.  The bottomless mimosas were worth that alone.  The bar staff had no problem when I asked for straight champagne since after 1 or 2 Mimosas they tend to be very sweet. The variety as expected at a Las Vegas buffett was plentiful.  I stayed strictly to breakfast  items but the lunch options did look good.  I went back for seconds on the corned beef hash it was the best part of the meal for me. The made to order omelet was great as well. I loaded my 1st plate to combine my 3 favorite breakfast meals with eggs Benedict, chicken fried steak with gravy and bagels with lox.  These were all good not great but the glutinous nature of the buffet experience makes up for that a little. There is always room for dessert! I tried a few single bites of multiple items but could not resist finishing the miniature pecan pie, decadent! Go early if you can, we waited 5 minutes around 9am by the time we left the line looked like an hour wait.	0	0	0

After taxes my family of 3 paid almost $70 and it was definitely not worth it. There was barely anything appetizing to eat, the variety is very limited. There is a lot of bread, a lot of cold salad, a small asian and italian station (very limited and unappealing). The food is not that hot and the taste was meh. The dessert and drinks section is decent. The staff is very attentive to clearing your dishes- which is the only reason why I gave this 2 rating instead of 1. I noticed a lot of other people left very quickly. Anyways it\\'s so expensive and not worth it, trust me! At the very least go in and take a look before you pay.	0	0	0

She definitely made the dinner a good time. \\nFood- this is where this restaurant unfortunately falls short. I had the baby kale salad which was actually quite good- the vinaigrette was tasty and the salad had a nice mix of flavors. My fiance had the onion soup (not what I would have picked at a seafood place) and it was just okay- not very flavorful and perhaps a little bit too much of a stretch from the classic (they put noodles in it and it didn\\'t have that fatty hunk of melted cheese on top). For dinner we ordered the Sea Bass which was very very bland, the brussels sprouts which were way too sweet, and the death by potatoes which were very delicious. If I were to go back I would have opted for more items from the salt and brine bar or the cold fare. \\nOverall this place was just okay, not sure if it was worth the expensive bill. However I think I would go back and just try different menu items because the service was great and the restaurant itself was so cool!	0	0	0

Hands down this place rocked!  The service was amazing, the food was fantastic..... I am an Emeril fan so I was excited to try it out.  The prices was very reasonable especially for being a top rated Vegas strip restaurant. Excited to try the other locations in NYC and NO now!	0	0	0

Yes! Very nicely done and it makes it a little more romantice with my gf.  Place does get crowded, but hey good food means you going to have to wait just a bit.  \\n\\nI came here with a group, everything was already arranged and yes it was very well presented.  We started with two apps (veggie eggrolls and wings).  Loved the wings and their dipping sauce (informed that it was just hotsauce and ranch).  The jerky with sticky rice and thai sauce, heaven.. Tiny bits of beef was very tender.  Because we were in a group the spiciness was set to mild.  Poo, I love hot stuff! Amazing noodles and pad thai were very solid choices.  I thought that it tasted just good, but could have been better if i was spicy.  Should go alone next time.  Another great entree is the chicken curry.  How good was it?  The guy across from me is a graduate from culinary school and he acutally asked for the rest of it to take home.  Enough said.  \\n\\nNow for you drinking folks.  There\\'s quite a selection on thai beer from what I heard.  I don\\'t drink, but most of the guys at the table did.  They got quite a bit that night.  \\n\\nDesserts! Fried bananas, a bit too much wrapping around the banana but then it works well since condensed milk is poured onto it.  Now the really appealing and interesting item was this egg cake with nutella baked.. Sorry don\\'t remember what it was called.  Surprisingly, it wasn\\'t really that bad once you start chewing.  I thought the egg was going to be weird but it was more like a flan with nutella.\\n\\nDef will be back.  Yes I\\'ll have to take my gf, but I want my noodles spicy!\\n\\nSide note: parking is difficult, but there is street parking around the corner on both ends.  Meter parking and free after 6pm.	0	0	0

If smoking really bothers you, avoid Circo, Jasmine, and Le Cirque, which are right next to the Casino.\\n\\n\\nService was fast, efficient, and attentive - without being intrusive.  5 stars for service.\\n\\nAtmosphere was quiet, with lots of space between tables.  You have a nice view of the kitchen and the plating going on , if that was your thing.\\n\\nFood was very good. We had the pork 3 ways, shellfish 3 ways, mussel souffle (surprisingly good).   A good combination of imagination without being weird.  Fish in phyllo was good, but a little too standard.\\n\\nI did not get a chance to try Sarah Kosikowski\\'s desserts, which are supposedly pretty good.\\n\\nHad a lot of fun, would return.

My friend and I walked In To an empty restaurant and bar.  We decided to be seated outside where we waited for 15 minutes without being served so we moved inside to the bar. We met Ryan 5 minutes later who seemed overwhelmed with 7 people at the bar. We finally got his attention and received  our drinks and asked him his favorite menu items. His suggestions were the Barratta, tuna poki and yellowfin which were delicious.  The manager Gino and Candice came over and checked in the both of us and asked how service was and we told him about our experience so far. Ryan told us \\" the best part of the evening is that our drinks were free\\" ( assuming it had to do with the lackadaisical service from earlier.) Everything tasted great but our final dish, It was the Grilled octopus.  It was softly grilled and a bit on the salty side. Our bill came and the drinks were included minus the grilled octopus.

It\\'s a pretty small location with a bar inside, but they crank out delicious Thai food. I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice, which is as advertised as a house specialty. The meat was some of the softest and most flavorful meat I\\'ve had, and they provide plenty of meat per plate. My boyfriend ordered the Awesome Noodles, extra spicy, and they delivered on the extra spicy. \\n\\nOverall, I\\'d recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food in the Vegas area.	1	0	1

Yeah, this is a fun place that\\'s got an edgy, hip vibe but the food is a basic rendition of standard Thai fare. It tastes good but these dishes done properly should.  Also, because Thai food generally tastes good when you are drunk or hung (the perfect combo of grease, salt and carbs), it serves the target demographic well. Not trying to be negative - I\\'ve had several perfectly fine meals here - just giving a realistic assessment.  Sober diners and those who know food should adjust expectations accordingly.  On the plus side, service has always been great.	0	0	0

Got drinks quick\\n\\nSelection: Lots more then something like Ryan\\'s or Golden Corral that\\'s for sure. it had asian, american, italian, desserts, etc. \\n\\nTaste: Most of the items I got tasted good. I did not like the penne pasta though the saue was way too high pitched. I like my pastas to have a low pitch and my pizzas to have a high pitch. This place got both in reverse. The Swai fish was my fav item there. Tasted really good. I had a lot of it. I also liked the \\"tit ravioli\\" it really looked like tits. LOL. but it was good. I also liked the turkey and I normally hate turkey. \\n\\nService: My sister has Celiac disease. She can not have gluten and the chef there was really professional and he was able to show her exactly what she can eat and since he made it he knows how it was made. Very nice. Buffets are next to impossible for her and this was awesome for her to be able to partake in a buffet. \\n\\nOverall: Highly recommended and very good. pricey though. \\n\\nOverall rating: 8.9/10	0	0	0

Entrees included the scallops with risotto, salmon, and White Sea bass- all were divine! The highlight of the meal other than the death by potatoes (so freaking buttery, creamy, cheesy, and silky) is the dessert. The mason jar sundae was huge, perfect for sharing! My dad had the carrot cake with pineapple sorbet which he really enjoyed. Would love to bring the fiancé here.	0	0	0

To be quite honest, the food was a little bit of a let down.

I always try to find something positive about anyplace I go to. \\n\\nThey advertised this place as a craft beer garden but it\\'s just a tourist trap.   I saw it on groupon so decided to give it a try while I was in Vegas this go around.  \\n\\nLooks pretty with plenty of Tvs for your viewing pleasure. It wasn\\'t to crowded so thought we would pop in and pop out for a quick meal. Got seated right away and that\\'s when it stopped being enjoyable. Took forever for our waitress to come take our drink orders. Took even longer for her to come back to get our food orders.  Beer is expensive here unless it\\'s Budweiser.\\n\\nWhen my beer finally came it wasn\\'t even cold. When my cheeseburger came it\\'s wasn\\'t even hot. To top it off you don\\'t even get a side with any entree. Bill for two people sharing a side and 2 beers was 87 dollars. Took about a hour and fifty five minutes to get all of this. Not at all worth the price for the sub standard food and poor service. Save your money and don\\'t bother with this place.	9	4	2

While I argee with some of my peers that while some of the portions could be larger for some of the dishes, others are spot on. Definitely enjoy the ambiance and great for a quick, informal date or group get together. Some nights have a DJ playing usually some sexy house music and the last time I visited the DJ was accompanied by a gentleman playing the bongos, adding extra, organic touch to the music. Service can be spotty as the night progresses and tables begin to fill. My last time out I noticed a couple leaving in a bit of frustration as the were largely ignored. \\n\\nOverall though its 3.5 but I\\'m giving it the benefit of the doubt, because unless Streats is going on its sorta slim picking for us foodies in the immediate area. But in comparison to the other Thai restaurants in Vegas there certainly are better.	1	1	1

For the price, I much prefer Le Cirque at Bellagio (see those yelp reviews, they are stellar!).  However, this is a good restaurant. I ordered from the pre-theater menu, and I was pleased that I was able to upgrade to the lobster pot pie for an addition 30 bucks. For the starter, I had the grilled cheese and soup (really yummy!). The pot pie was good, with an entire lobster in it, although I probably wouldn\\'t order it again because I\\'m really not a big fan of pot pie. The sauce in it is good, so I\\'m not complaining... I just wasn\\'t blown away like everyone else. I had the root bear float and cookies, and I was NOT impressed with either. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good, but again not nearly as good as Le Cirque. The atmosphere also wasn\\'t anything too special. So overall, above average food, but I\\'ve had better dining experiences in Vegas.	0	0	0

We were seated and our server, Leon greets our table, confirms the Travel Zoo, then says don\\'t concern yourselves with the restrictions just order whatever you\\'d like and the TZ certificate will apply! That was a great way to start our dining experience for sure!\\n  We all started with cocktails, 2 martinis, a Jameson rocks & for me a Manhattan....... Mine was EXCELLENT SERVED ICEY COLD W/ a splash of cherry juice = PERFECTION!!! The Toni\\'s came with Blue Cheese olives always a nice touch.\\n    The filet (10 oz) the smallest available unless you want Kobe.... Just DEEELISSH, cooked medium was tasty not over seasoned you know seared on the outside and beautiful pinkish red on the inside. \\n     A nice change of pace are the Humongous muffins they serve before dinner instead of bread ~ these things are served hot out of the oven & are FAB!! We ordered traditional sides loaded baked potatoes, green beans & asparagus ~ all were prepared al Dente except the potatoes & with a touch of butter.\\n     Couldn\\'t have asked for a better steak meal ~ NOT one misstep, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you check out BLT inside Bally\\'s you will be happy you did!	2	1	0

The food is beautifully prepared and the service is great too. Exactly what you would expect from a place with the Mina name. I was lucky to enjoy a 5 (or was it 7?) course meal with wine pairing. So, I got to try a little of everything. The main dishes were good, as well as a perfect dessert finish. Great dining atmosphere as well- dim, clean, and not too noisy.	0	0	0

I didn\\'t really appreciate the seating... Since we sat next to a cleaning station. Not impressed. Wanted something equivalent to mastros but it wasn\\'t even remotely close. It just looks nice but tasted... Mediocre. The ribeye would of been better if I made it myself. They were seriously off their game.. Was hoping to be \\"wowed\\" but I definitely had better.. This isn\\'t a must have. Only eat here for convenience if you are staying at the hotel.	1	0	0

It\\'s flavorful, has exquisite marbling, and served at a medium rare perfection.\\n\\nBut that\\'s where the hype ends.  Sure, the lobster bisque is good and the shrimp appetizer is tasty, but for what we paid overall, I know there are better options here in the city.  \\n\\nSo, I would say to you -- go for their Bone-in Ribeye and leave all other expectations behind.  It\\'s a great meal, just didn\\'t make it to my list of favorites.	3	1	1

This is located in Palazzo in the walkway towards the venetian.  Both times i ordered the bone-in rib eye, and both times it was pretty good.  This latest time i ordered Medium-Rare, but it was definitely more on the medium side.  I should have been more upset it wasn\\'t cooked exactly how i wanted it, but it was still good.  \\n\\nFor dessert, i was pretty excited to try the Banana Cream Pie, but it was pretty average.  It had  A LOT of bananas and didn\\'t really blow me away with flavor.   It was like eating a big banana with whip cream.  I probably wouldn\\'t get it again.  \\n\\nThe service was pretty good, but i wish they didn\\'t sit us right next to the kitchen entrance.  It gets annoying to have people constantly walking by you with food and dishes.	2	0	0

The food and service was impeccable and atmosphere very nice.   I have been to  a Moroccan restaurant before and I think the food was a bit more exotic or cultural.  The food was excellent but I think the dinner selections that were chosen were \\"safe\\" for people trying Moroccan food for the first time verses authentic.    When I\\'ve had Moroccan food previously some of our party found it quite a change for their palettes this time less so,  more mainstream or safe for those picky eaters.   That worked good for the kids.   I would\\'ve like a more cultural experience where I felt I was trying something new.  However it was great anyway.	0	0	0

But I digress...).  We came here with some free buffet tickets in hand (you\\'ve GOT to love free Vegas!) and without much of an appetite so we didn\\'t try much.  Overall, the French Market Buffet isn\\'t anything amazing, BUT it does have everything.  There were sections of food \\"types\\":  American, Mexican, Seafood, Asian, Italian and they each had a really decent selection.  The food was okay, the service was actually pretty good, and the atmosphere was typical buffet.  I think this is definitely a decent choice if you are staying here and want to eat on the cheap or with a lot of choices, but I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to come here if I wasn\\'t (especially with the other [better] choices that The Orleans offers).	2	1	2

I had the halibut, it was delicious. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and he was pleasantly surprised! For a seafood place this was one of the best steaks he ever had!

The food was excellent quality at both places. But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico\\'s. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn\\'t think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like. \\n\\nI told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I\\'m a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.\\n\\nSo despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.	1	1	1

I remember coming here during a normal dinner time like 7pm. The parking lot was packed maybe because of all the stores/ restaurants in that plaza. However when we came in there was only one other family eating that was about to leave. The customer service is good. They\\'re friendly. The food comes out pretty fast. The location was a little hard to find in the dark but it\\'s right across from the Tea Station plaza. I would definitely come back here for pho because of the reasonable cheap price and the servings they good are bountiful! the regular size is pretty filling I couldn\\'t finish it one sitting!	0	0	0

We were a party of 4 and all had the 12 course meal. I won\\'t go into detail about each course except to say that every course was perfect. This is a lot of food, these courses are not tiny samples, they are small plates and around course 6 and 7 you start feeling it. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas, such a tremendous value and such incredible food. I have noticed some yelpers complaining about the time it takes......IT\\'S 12 COURSES, you don\\'t get them all at once, that would be dumb. Allocate 2-3 hours to enjoy this feast, and then you too can write witty 5 star comments on Yelp.	0	0	0

The sofa is not good for shorty (under 6ft).  I have to elevate myself in order to cut into my steak.  Note to self:  No sofa seating.  Another couple was seated next to us.  Immediately, the lady asked to switch seat with her tall husband.\\n\\nService:  Professional and knowledgeable\\n\\nFood:\\n-Appetizer:  Tuna Tartare surprised me with its flavor at a Morden American Steakhouse.  I\\'d order it again.  I also order crab cake but my waitress did not hear my order.  So, we bypassed it.\\n-Comps:  Pâté is a good start with couple slices of crunchy bread. The popover is warm on arrival.  One pop per person  It was a good bake.  Sea salt and butter is it\\'s company.\\n-Entrees:\\nNY Strip 16oz (Medium is Pink, Hot Center) is perfect for my normal medium rare but it is referred as the medium here.\\nBone-In Ribeye 22oz (Medium Rare is Red, Warm Center)\\nRefer to the Steak Temp on the left-hand side of the menu.  It ranges from Blue (very red, cold center) to Well Done (no pink, hot center).\\nSides:\\nOnion Rings is not the kind I liked.  It is not crispy on the outside and the onion is not very sweet.  But, the onion is fresh and crunchy on the inside.  I will pass this side next time.\\nTruffle Mashed (Potato) is heavenly smooth and infused with truffle.\\nDessert:  Sundaes.  I am not a sundaes person but I wanted to try something different.  Again, it surprised me.  The sundaes come in a classic tall glass with a long spoon.  The ice cream quality is high and flavors are well paired with each other.  Each bite comes with a little surprise like a piece of chocolate, or a yummy crunchy piece of candy.  If all sundaes are like this one, I will be in love with sundaes all over again.\\n\\nThis is a quality restaurant inside Bally\\'s.\\n\\nTips:\\n-Since parking is no longer free, I planned my day at and around Bally\\'s.  We visited the Bodies exhibit at Bally\\'s on the lower level.  Then, We walked across the bridge to Bellagio to see the water fountain, seasonal display.  By this time, it is about time for my dinner reservation here.  After dinner, we walked to Paris for a little more site seeing.  Instead of walking back to where we came from, we exit the Paris hotel & casino and walked on the strip and back into Bally\\'s garage.\\n-I asked if I can take the menu home with me because I like the Angus Beef Chart reference on the back of the menu.  The waitress gladly gave me one to keep.	0	0	0

There was a good variety of foods for the Christmas Day menu, but flavor was average.  Our waitress never came to check on us and when we needed a refill on drinks, we had to track her down.  Because our waitress never checked on us, our used plates were piling up.  A couple of other waitresses were clearing off a table nearby, so we brought our used plates to them and asked if we could hand the plates over to them.  Their response, \\"Yah, I guess.\\	0	1	0

The omelette guy messed both of our omelette up. He only listened to the first three things we said and then just did his thing. Not at all impressive. Go somewhere else.

Every request was met with snarky comeback or outright rude response.  I left furious and angry.  Don\\'t know his name, older short man with glasses during evening service during weekday.\\n\\nAt least 3 times when I very politely asked for something (a side sauce, remove the extra wineglass, get a to go box), I was told with a straight face \\'NO.\\' \\'WHY?\\'  I was just shocked. Never have I had this even at McDonald\\'s. then he followed with \\'of course you can\\' as if it were funny. \\n\\nI came here for a fine dining experience, not to banter or entertain you at my expense.  \\n\\nYou barely attended to us, you ignored stacks of empty dishes on our table. If you were remotely competent I might have overlooked the attitude. \\n\\nAs CET diamond I received complimentary appetizers from another waiter, who also jokingly pushed back when I nicely asked for a to go box.  This must be going around the staff.  I told him I already got the humor from the first guy so he backed down, though I still had to justify for 2 minutes on why I needed a box.\\n\\nI take it this is some form of passive aggressive stress relief to treat customers like sh*t, jokingly tell them \\'NO\\' when you are asked to do something?! I\\'m not laughing.  \\n\\nSave your attitude and poor humor, it\\'s unprofessional and we don\\'t have time for it. \\n\\nCustomers get few opportunities to come out for a good experience. My time is valuable and this isn\\'t exactly pocket change.  You just ruined my night.\\n\\nDon\\'t bother going there unless you want to chance the same.	2	1	0

What a happy accident! We came here, six of us, including two Korean sisters, who declared the food better than the best of K-town in New York City. Though I\\'m not Korean, I agree. Possibly the best jap chae I\\'ve ever had, divine banchan, and delicious, homemade-tasting everything else. This sleeper is a gem.	1	0	0

Of the pieces of pork we did get the quarters of the biggest piece was just fat. The pork belly is also not a traditional braised pork belly there is a lot of sweetness in it.\\n\\nWe also ordered the shoyu ramen which smelled amazing bur actually tasted very bland. As you drink from the bowl you think the soup will be amazing from the smell coming off of it only to be disappointed by its lack of flavor.  \\n\\nLastly we ordered the buns two each of the duck and pork belly. These weren\\'t bad but different probably because I like more traditional tastes. Both had spicy mayo on them which made it really sweet and the pork belly was super greasy.\\n\\nTo sum it up, if your going to come here get a pork belly dish as the flavor from it will make your experience here more pleasant. If you\\'re going to come late in the night they stop seating at like 11:30 though they choose at 12, but you can at least get take out.	2	1	0

How do you bring out four entrees and forget two? They forgot about ladies first. What is chef Geno thinking, is he trying to make memories, or just make money. The service was 1 star. I understand this is a new restaurant, but with 4.2 million dollars to open they could have worked out the kinks. I appreciate chef working on a Monday, but why, it didn\\'t help anything. He must have been getting his jollies off with the bar crowd. $400 dollar meal with 4/6 entrees, get real! This place needs a wake up call. Your in the Aria, step up or bring in Chef David Burke. I would have rather eaten at bonefish grill.	0	0	0

Earl of Sandwich, the (gross) 24-hour cafe at Paris, and Tequila Bar at Bally\\'s...that\\'s all we could come up with around our hotel after a long night of gambling and drinking.  Sad.\\n\\nSince we just wanted to grab something quick before rejoining our friends upstairs, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla appetizer.  I figured it would be small and simple, but it was really simple.  After popping open the lid, I was greeted with four triangles of quesadilla with scoops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side.  Really not that impressive, even though it was about what I had expected.  \\n\\nWhile they put in a decent amount of chicken, the taste was underwhelming - just not enough spice.  Had there been more cheese, it would have helped the flavor...but it would have made it even oilier.  It was already bad enough seeing the grease/oil it left behind in the container, it was even worse seeing it again in the morning (\\"Oh man...what the hell were we thinking...\\").  For whatever reason, it reminded me of what you get from the food stands at sporting events.\\n \\nAlthough the food is pretty mediocre, I can\\'t say Tequila Bar was terrible since my friend thought his burger was decent.  They have some cheap deals if you\\'re looking to stay on a budget ($2 tacos it seems), but I would probably just go over to Earl of Sandwich for some late eats.  Otherwise, they might not be bad for some margaritas and cocktails - the ones we saw the bartender make looked pretty enticing.	3	4	4

Le Thai has recently made most of their menu (except curries* and pad thai) vegan! And they serve beer and liquor.  And they are open late! And they have a patio!\\n!!!!\\nSo, the Massaman curry actually is vegan, and it\\'s delicious.  As are the Awesome Noodles, which totally live up to their name.  Just remember to ask for your dish with no fish sauce or egg.  The spring rolls were quite good as well.  Wash it all down with my favorite new drink, the Lady Boy (Thai whiskey with gingerale and lime).  They also have a rum-based drink that tastes EXACTLY like grape kool-aid.  \\n\\nIt is very small inside, but has a good sized patio.  This will be a wonderful place to eat for the 3 weeks a year that vegas is neither too chilly or blazing hot.  Kidding! I\\'m a trooper, sort of.  And they have heat lamps out there now, so really just do it.  \\n\\nThe menu is small, but everything is tasty, so who cares?  I can\\'t wait to get back and more things. \\n\\nThis is a really great addition to downtown, and a much needed source of vegan-friendly late night eats.	6	0	3

My husband and I like to eat different things, so buffets work out well for us.  We both really liked the steak with peppercorn sauce (one of the best peppercorn sauces I have ever had) and the pot roast with cilantro (amazing and I\\'m still trying to figure out the recipe).  My husband enjoyed the seafood and I loved the salad bar, although they should add an non creamy dressing option like Italian or oil and vinegar.  The deserts were fantastic and small so you could sample several without feeling overly stuffed.  We can\\'t wait to return the next time we are in Vegas.	0	0	0

Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here. \\n\\nUpon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn\\'t look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.\\n\\nI ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.\\n\\nThe mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it\\'s better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that\\'s a perfect burger in my book!\\n\\nTheir smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren\\'t burnt or brown-looking). I usually don\\'t like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!\\n\\nI was delighted that this is near campus because it\\'s super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It\\'s a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can\\'t go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!	7	6	7

I ordered a small iced wintermelon green tea less sweetened, and a friend had the regular iced lavender green milk tea with boba. The wintermelon green tea was great, very refreshing. I\\'d say the lavender milk tea was a bit weak, a little too much milk and not enough of a lavender flavor. But on the plus side, the drink portions are plenty. If you are familiar with KFT, a small size here at Tea Space would be the same as a medium at Kung Fu, and a regular a large. Although having a large-sized regular is a good deal, the regular sized lavender milk tea wasn\\'t cold enough because the ice would remain at the top of such a tall cup..\\nThey have a stamp card for a free drink after ten. The staff is very friendly and service is good. There is an art wall on the interior where local artists have displayed art (mostly of cats) for sell. Great idea, it not only benefits and supports local artists, but also the cafe and its interior decorations.\\nWould definitely go back with my stamp card and try more drinks!	2	0	1

The broth was a bowl of thin liquid devoid of even the slightest hint of pork flavor in any spoonful. I swear it was simply tan colored water with a slight sheen of some sort of oily substance masquerading itself as the expected pork fat goodness one finds at an actual ramen bar. Even the pork belly itself was as flavorless as the broth...it had the texture of actual pork but failed to provide even a tease of flavor. The noodles were white...that\\'s the best I can do with that. The eggs were there pleading to be released from the embarrassment of this $12 bowl of a ramen imposter. The only flavor came from a teaspoon of shredded pickled ginger haphazardly strewn in there where it most certainly did not belong.\\nI was honestly surprised that the Asians eating there weren\\'t jumping up and yelling \\"FRAUD\\". \\n\\nStay away and do yourself the favor of seeking out one of the delightful truthful ramen houses down on Spring Mountain.	1	0	0

I am a rib fanatic so I definitely wanted to try their ribs. I gotta say I was very disappointed in the ribs. I thought they were a bit dry and the bbq sauce was not good. Very thin and too mild. A good bbq sauce is the foundation of great bbq. Come on Rollin Smoke! Y\\'all need to go back to the kitchen and come up with a new recipe. The brisket was dry. The greens were subpar.

I usually like to keep my reviews positive, but this experience was horrible from start to finish. The only reason we went here is because we had free vouchers from the hotel. If we would have had to pay for this, we would have been severely disappointed. We waited in line for 20 minutes while there were many open tables. Everything we tried was terrible and we felt that we wasted so much food from everything we didn\\'t eat.  The best thing we had was the soft serve ice cream which is hard to mess up. Second best was the salad bar that we created ourselves from the ingredients available. Terrible items tried: pizza, brisket, ground beef nachos, kielbasa (the absolute worst! Couldn\\'t even choke it down), the lasagna, garlic bread...you get the picture I\\'m sure. With all that Vegas and the MGM Grand has to offer, I wouldn\\'t bother making this a stop during your stay.	2	0	0

It was pretty empty, so we were seated quickly. \\n\\nThe biggest thing that pestered me here is their slow service. In a typical pho place, you sit down, get your order taken within 2 minutes, and a hot bowl comes out in no more than 10 minutes. Here, we waited a good 10 minutes before our order was taken, then another 5 to get water, then maybe 20-30 just to get our food. I understand there were 8 of us, but it still shouldn\\'t take that long. Maybe the workers were all just too busy watching the Wold Cup final game.\\n\\nI got a Com Thit Nuong (Grilled BBQ pork With Rice - $7.95). Broken rice was great, but the pork did not impress. Thin, dried out pieces. I\\'ve had better elsewhere. \\n\\nNot sure how the pho is, but rice dishes are mediocre. Combine that with really slow service and it\\'s not the most appealing place around. At least bathrooms are clean and the World Cup was on.	0	0	0

Most everything was closed, but we found Cheffini\\'s right near the entrance of the park area. I ordered the Crunchy dog, with onions, red peppers, bacon bits, crushed potato chips, seaweed, sriracha mayo, mustard and fry sauce. Seriously though, I could have ordered anything off the menu and probably would have been very happy. There was a bit of a wait because they had just dropped a new batch of dogs, but I didn\\'t mind. The hot dog came out and it was glorious. Somehow all the crazy toppings complemented each other perfectly and it all tasted amazing. It was a bit too salty for my taste, but my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing and I probably could have shared another. They also have fries, empanadas, sliders and a burger option. You can get a beef dog, turkey dog, or a vegan dog too.\\n\\nIf you like gourmet hot dogs, do not miss this place if you\\'re in the area.	1	0	0

My wife found the restaurant from a blog of a Japanese resident of the town.  The location is off-the strip, and in a strip mall of the middle of Chinatown.  Nonetheless, the chef Takashi offered perfection of his creation.  We had nearly ten kinds of nigiri type sushi, fish on rice, plus grilled mackerel, fish cake stew, miso soup and pickled vegi.  Materials are very fresh, and precisely prepared.  Sushi rice was perfectly cooked and flavored. Of special note, the chef brighten up the flavor of salmon roe by marinating as the northern Japanese way.  The pickled vegi is also the northern Japanese version with rice based flavor.  Mackerel was nicely chosen and cooked perfectly.  The chef made great effort for the miso soup and fish cake stew, which can be recommended for every one who loves real Japanese food.  Another surprise came in the end, with the extremely generous size of bill.  I am sure that this restaurant will be the best sushi place in my town if he opens one. Or, I need to find a job in LV.	0	0	0

I think the lowest meal price you can get away with would be around $8-9 for the smallest size of Smashburger, regular fries and a soda. \\n\\nYou start by picking your burger size. I had one of their \\"$12 for $7 coupons\\" so I sprung for the largest bacon cheeseburger combo\\'d up w/ Smashfries and drink, which was just over $12 before coupon. For the most Bigly of the burger sizes, I was expecting a meaty patty akin to a small double cheeseburger. What I got was more like what I expected the \\"regular\\" size to be ... in fact the patty didn\\'t even fill the regular-size bun.  The beef was also questionable, like when you buy high-fat cheap Walmart burger meat, mush it into a patty at home to fry in a pan and don\\'t drain it off, and it comes out all fat-drippy. Regarding beef quality, their website says they use \\"100% Angus\\" but that\\'s basically a meaningless marketing term (http://www.chowhound.com/post/angus-beef-marketing-term-642330). I expect $12 a meal for a good grass-fed burger, not so much Walmart ground beef. \\n\\nI know this is an individualized thing, but they do shoestring fries here, which are by far my least favorite of the french fry styles. The \\"Smashfries\\" upgrade is only 20 cents extra but I don\\'t feel like it really improves the experience -- they\\'re just tossed in olive oil and rosemary, which makes them taste more like a flavored potato chip. \\n\\nTo conclude on a positive, the restroom is one-at-a-time and well kept. Also better seating environment than most fast food with a lot of high-backed booths.\\n\\ntl;dr for an asking price of $12 I feel like the burger size and quality of the beef and the fries is just not quite there. It\\'s a little better than the bottom-dollar fast food chains, but not enough to justify double or more the price. Opening up right next to In-N-Out is ... well, \\"bold\\" if you want to be nice, \\"suicidal\\" if you want to be brutally honest. I\\'m no big fan of In-N-Out but it\\'s definitely a vastly superior value proposition with the quality not standing up here.	0	0	0

Although very visually appealing, the dogs were lacking in both quality and quantity for the price. I have had many \\"custom\\" and \\"unique\\" hotdogs and while I appreciate what they are trying to do here, it just fell short. Seemingly made to order dogs are topped with assembly line ingredients that you can tell are not fresh. I had the panchero dog and the sautéed onions were at least a day old. For the price I would expect all ingredients to be cooked fresh. Another reason I am giving a lower review is the staff, the girl at the counter today carried an attitude and was very unapproachable and unhelpful when it was clear I had not been before and didn\\'t know the menu. All in all if you are in Container Park I would try something else. This place was overpriced and definitely under delivered!	3	0	0

Almost immediately, our aprehension disapeared and turned into excitement.  The restaurant was very nice and elegant.  It was a little dark at first but our eyes adjusted quickly and it became apparant that BLT takes pride in their restaurant.  We spent the next few minutes admiring the decor and layout.\\n\\nWe were greeted by Leslie and Conrad (a great team I might add), and the experience just got better.  Conrad went to filling drinks while Leslie took the time to explain the menu and make suggestions (with no pressure).  All we can say is....WOW!  These two made an amazing team and really took care of us; and to be honest, even if the food was just good - because of them we would still come back.\\n\\nNow to the food, they started us out with a couple popovers, then followed by pâté.  Shortly after that we had our mixed drinks (Old Cuban\\'s, which are kind of like a hybrid between a Mojito and a Long Island, very good!).  The popovers were nothing short of amazing (and they give you the recipe!) and the pâté made me want to move in.  I know it sounds bad but I wouldn\\'t let go of the dish it came in until it was clean (no REALLY).  Next, we split a delicious salad, while still being pampared by Leslie and Conrad.  Finally came the steak (the Porterhouse for 2). \\n\\nIt was perfectly cooked (medium is our preference) and already sliced for sharing.  We also got two sides, truffle potatoes and stuffed mushrooms, both are a must!  At the first bite, we were hooked!  After all that food, we still finished all 36 mouthwatering ounces.  For dessert, we were too full so they brought us two amazing little brownies that satisfied our dessert cravings.\\n\\nWe cannot recommend BLT Steak enough!  It is already on our return list for next time we are in Las Vegas.	0	0	0

The restaurant seemed a bit small but I love the fact they had out door patio seating with air misters to keep us comfortable. We were seated immediately. We were greeted my our waiter promptly. we ordered an appetizer/egg rolls and the short rib friend rice and the vegetable sir fry with chicken. our Appetizer came out shortly after we ordered and when we took a bite into the egg rolls the center was cold almost frozen...was a bi disappointed on the appetizer. we sent it back. it seemed as though it took awhile to get our food. 35 min or so. no complaints tho the place was busy for 9pm on a Thursday night. once the food was received the short rib fried was was excellent and our stir fry just as good...our waiter seemed very busy and did not return to check on us for awhile. no drink refills until we asked for our check. our experience here was so/so. we liked our entrees so we may return to give Le Thai another shot and try other things on the menu.	1	0	0

The servers are to scantily clad to be efficient in pouring wine or water. This restaurant feels like a soft opening. I see the runners advising the servers and the couches are awkward to eat.

Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he\\'s not the one cooking my meal, then it\\'s not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio\\'s buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you\\'re saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\\n\\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn\\'t stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet\\'s looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn\\'t a proper meal we would\\'ve gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \\"Generous Cut\\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\\n\\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I\\'ve ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\\n\\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They\\'re one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\\n\\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.	1	1	1

I enjoy being the Guinea pig for a new restaurant in town!  ...aaaand this is how I ended up at Sushi Takashi for a solo dinner tonight!  \\n\\nI arrived at about 8:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. Kawika was my server and took care of me from start to finish.  He filled my water, took my order, brought out all of my food, and took my dirty dishes.  He was very attentive and although it was slow, seemed to have that sense of urgency I appreciate in a full service restaurant. \\n\\nI ordered the $15.95 combo plate with 2 orders of teriyaki chicken and a half order of the Hakodate signature roll (yellowtail, ponzu, jalapeño). To drink, I just had water. \\n\\nFood came out quick and was plated beautifully. I started with the salad which was definitely overdressed, but still delicious. I\\'ll ask for light dressing next time. The chicken was thin cut (love it when Japanese restaurants do this!) and the sauce was watery, but it didn\\'t seem to take away from the flavor. Maybe it\\'s just a house-made teriyaki sauce?!  Either way, no complaints.  The roll was delicious. I love when sushi rolls have slices of jalapeño on top that are effective enough to taste + have a little bit of the seeds still attached. I hate those itty bitty small jalapeño slices that some sushi places put on top. Where do they even get jalapeños that small?!  Lol. \\n\\nMiso soup came with the meal and was ok.  I literally ate everything off of the plate, including the ginger. Lol. I was satisfied, but was craving something sweet...so I opted for the fried Oreos ($4.95).  How do you mess up fried Oreos?!  I mean, really you can\\'t!  Yum. Yum. Yum. \\n\\nMy check was $22, great value for what I got! \\n\\nI definitely want to come back with my boyfriend and go for the 12 course meal that I\\'ve read about from fellow yelpers!  Will update my review after I wake up from that coma. :)\\n\\nP.s. They have the best tasting \\"tap water\\" ever. I saw a sign on the wall that says its Fuji water or something...not sure what that is, but it was really good and definitely worth mentioning. I love when restaurants add little perks like that. It\\'s those small things that leave the biggest impact!	3	0	4

My boyfriend enjoyed the drinks there he\\'s favorite was the Japanese whiskey. For the main dish I had the Salmon and my boyfriend got the Branzino. The fish was extremely delicious and fresh.

From Massachusetts to California, we have been to so many Indian restaurants but we can say with confidence that this was the best samosa we have ever had. We were staying in the strip and came here 4 times in 3 days. Their thali is amazing; chapati, kadi, chole everything was great!  We tried chole bhature and many chat and everything was fresh and yummy. Alu ka parantha is huge but tasty and nicely cooked. Everything feels home made not oily like typical Indian restaurant.

The restaurant is located off strip so prepared to take a cab. \\n\\nYes, the dining room is one large room and fairly small compared to other Vegas restaurants, but I liked the ambiance, finding that it lent to the intimacy of the experience. Guests are seated on couches at low tables. Be prepared to eat with your hands (they do provide rose water for cleansing before dining.) \\n\\nI enjoyed almost all of the food during the six courses served: warm bread, shrimp, soup, steak kabobs, chicken and rice, and a banana & chocolate souffle-type pastry. While the food wasn\\'t mind-blowing, I did enjoy it. \\n\\nBelly dancing is dispersed throughout the evening. The women will encourage others to get up and dance with them.

First we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\\n            We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\\n           The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\\n          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.\\n         Luckily there\\'s one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\\n        Going back? No way, very expensive and I\\'m not happy.	0	0	0

A spectacular bar spans the entire interior wall. Sofa seating is terrific for cocktails and apps, but a little awkward for full meals. The patio space is absolute perfection, and my favorite outdoor dining space in Las Vegas. Austin is by far, one of the better waiters on The Strip. He orchestrates table service perfectly and knows the menu, wine and cocktail list well. Chef Geno Bernardo is at the top of his game, and everything is fantastic. We usually start with a shellfish platter (try the kimchee meunière sauce), fresh fish crudo, and salads. The sea bass ceviche was the best I\\'ve ever had! Of the hot apps, I\\'m a fan of the octopus, calamari and meatballs. Geno\\'s meatballs and toast is probably my favorite plate. I could make a meal of it daily! I have a tough time getting to the entrees. I skip straight to the desserts. Don\\'t miss the sundae, carrot cake and cookies & milk. Oh, and the pannacotta... Herringbone won\\'t disappoint.	1	0	0

If you have ever had tonkatsu ramen, either instant or at another, decent noodle house, you would realize it is savory. Their take on it was so bland it was nearly nauseating. The friend that went with my fiance and I were appalled and couldn\\'t finish.\\n\\nTheir pork belly was stringy, almost undistinguishable from the bamboo. Broth was incredibly oily. Servings were way too large -- definitely quantity over quality. \\n\\nService was okay, no complaints there. Restaurant tries too hard overall to be upscale when it is technically open air -- all the sounds and smells from the casino waft in. They also charged 4 dollars for pepsi, which is ridiculous.	0	0	0

(Well maybe not, If you\\'ve been to Tom Urban) I ordered the Redondo beach(Sushi burrito with salmon/tuna and some other veggies). The rice is rolled really thin which isn\\'t a bad thing. But the the size of the thing is small. There\\'s just nothing special about it. It\\'s like they just rolled fish and veggies in seaweed with rice and called it a day. Taste nothing like sushi or fresh poke. To top it off they don\\'t even roll their on burritos, they just use a machine. \\n\\nIf you\\'re from the bay and you\\'ve been to sushirrito, Jaburritos doesn\\'t compare in any way. Don\\'t sell yourself short especially for an average of $13-$15 a piece to only be half the size with no avocados in sight. \\n\\nAs far as the service, it\\'s fast and as it should be. I\\'m just not sure why folks are so high on this.	4	0	0

Came here with my girlfriend and her 7- year old daughter on a Sunday for the all you can eat for 12.99 per person ( they charged her daughter 10.99 ) We read online that they had two menus, but upon arriving they handed us one menu that was missing many items that was supposed to be on the second menu.That made me a bit apprehensive, and while I was trying to decide if it was still worth it, an older Asian woman encouraged us to sit and asked us what we wanted to drink -I told her Thai tea, but she insisted on a different tea-she said it would be very good-so I went along with what she recommended. While we were looking over the menu (since it was not a buffet already laid out ) the woman again very strongly encouraged us to order two of anything so \\" we wouldn\\'t take all day\\" . We ordered -as she insisted- two of each -egg rolls , chicken wings, potstickers, rice , and one bowl of pho. Everything we ordered was very small-usually just two or three pieces EXCEPT for the rice which was piled high on a big plate-enough to fill 5-6 people. After eating all of our food except for only being able to eat about a quarter of the rice plate,I asked for the check (since we were all stuffed) The woman then proceeded to tell me I had to finish eating the rice or I would be charged for another separate order. I thought she was joking, but she then said that I was wasting their food and I had to pay if I didn\\'t eat it! Talk about cheap!! First of all they didn\\'t even have all the items on the menu ( false advertising to get you inside) and then they don\\'t have any food prepared (as in a buffet) then they PUSH you to order too much( I wanted to just try one of each thing at first in case I didn\\'t like it) . Then they try to trick you by making you pay for whatever you can\\'t eat!!? The woman said she told me when I ordered that I would have to pay extra if I didn\\'t eat it all (TOTAL LIE!)\\nNeedless to say-I was angry and told her I wasn\\'t paying extra-my total for three people for LUNCH was already $50 , and it was not good at all -then I am given a total con line that I would expect at the strip from a street criminal! I left no tip and will not return -BEWARE!!	0	0	0

How unfortunate! There is no where to sit (standing counters only), the food is too messy to eat at your gate chair. The food has been put through a de-flavorizer and all you can think if is, \\'why didn\\'t we eat before we left the hotel. Big mistake.	1	1	0

We didn\\'t have a ton of Thai places back home in Tucson, so coming here, there is a crazy amount! Le Thai is the best I\\'ve had in Vegas/Henderson so far.\\n\\nWe took a seat on the patio, hoping it wasn\\'t as hot as it was outside there, and they had misters going it was a very comfortable temperature. The patio has beautiful murals and lights. It feel like you aren\\'t in the middle of the somewhat grungy area of Fremont. It\\'s peaceful and eclectic.\\n\\nI am a sucker for Tom Kha soup at ANY restaurant but its always a pleasant surprise to see it done super well. And the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Fried Egg Rolls were super good. Even though the prices are a little higher than the dirt cheap usual prices of Thai restaurant, once you take a bite you realize why. It is so, so good! \\n\\nTom Kha Soup: Me and my husband ALWAYS share this whenever we get Thai food. He hates the mushrooms, I pass on the larger pieces of chicken and it works out perfectly. This soup was the best I\\'ve had. We got a 3/10 on the spice scale. Not looking to die today. And it was the perfect amount of spice. Didn\\'t make your face fall off but also you still got a tiny kick. But if you are a fan of spicy, go ahead and order a high number. I\\'m sure its fantastic.\\n\\nFried Egg Rolls & Plum Sauce: Yum. I\\'m always a sucker for an egg roll. Those and Crab Rangoons are my favorite when it comes to fried apps. These were veggie only. And they were delicious. Not super greasy, as they should be and not flaming hot. As in, we could actually take a full on bite right when they got to the table. Which is how it should be done!\\n\\nShort Rib Fried Rice: This was a new one for me. I\\'m a big fan of fried rice and short rib just sounded good. Oh and it was. There was so much flavor in this one. And the short rib wasn\\'t too fatty, which can ruin short rib for me. Every big piece of short rib was fully flavorful meat and not all stretched out with fat. There was a great amount of short rib in the rice too. It was very balanced. I would definitely share this as an entree and try other stuff on the menu like appetizers. That way you get to try a little of each. \\n\\nI will definitely be returning to this place and tying some other menu items. Maybe some noodles next time. Who knows? I\\'m sure it will be delicious.	3	1	2

And coming from me, that\\'s really big because I really do try to avoid Thai/Lao places since I kinda eat that everyday at home. I would totally come here again. You must try the short rib fried rice. And if you do a check-in you can get a free iced coffee. The spice was just enough for me (I\\'m that Asian that doesn\\'t like spice haha). Also had the Pad Thai which was really good too.	0	0	3

Processed eggs/ liquid eggs that comes in a big box or plastic bag aka \\"fake eggs\\".Totally brought me back memories eating them in Freshman year in college. Gross!\\n\\nThey had...\\nPlane fake scrambled eggs\\nfake scrambled eggs with shredded cheese and \\nfake scrambled eggs with onions and bell peppers...COME ON!\\n\\nThey had an omelette station though, but I\\'m not sure if they use real eggs. I didn\\'t even bother to look.\\n\\nBesides the fake eggs, the food selection was pretty basic and plain. I mean, compare to the other buffets I\\'ve tried in Vegas like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon and The Buffet at Wynn,  it was a big disapoinment. Nothing I\\'d come back for, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nThe only food I liked were the chicken sausage, smoked salmon, mac and cheese,  prime rib and bread pudding. Stay away form the sushi rolls. Hard rice and smelly fish, oh goodness! \\n\\nGood thing it was complimentary by MGM because I would never pay $26.99 (Weekend brunch) for this kind of food. Yeah, they gave us free food for the inconvinience we experienced in our room. I still have to do a review about it.	3	2	1

This visit was a pleasant end to my two-week birthday vacation.  \\n\\nThe six-course Moroccan feast is a prixe fixe menu consisting of:\\n\\n1. Moroccan Style Lamb Sausage with onions and tomatoes (shellfish substitute)\\n2. Harira Soup (Lentil, rice, lemon, and spices)\\n3. Marrakech Sampler (Hummus (garbanzo/tahini dip), Baba ghannouj (eggplant/tahini dip), Moroccan style olives, cucumbers, beets, and carrots)\\n4. Beef Brochette (Beef kabob - marinated and grilled)\\n5. Royal Moroccan CousCous platter with Djaj (Chicken, assorted vegetables including butternut squash and cabbage)\\n6. B\\'stilla (Moroccan pastry stuffed with fruits and nuts topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon, and served with traditional mint tea.)\\n\\nHomemade Moroccan bread is served with each course.\\n\\nTo drink, I had the Marrakech Mojito (Bacardi muddled with fresh mint, lime & sugar, topped with a splash of soda and a hint of rose water).	0	0	1

I had the light club sandwich which had a hearty portion of turkey and ham on it, with side of fresh fruit that\\'s served with a sweet delicious yogurt and a cup of the vegetarian vegetable soup. Soup was ok- I usually get the chicken pot pie soup which is absolute bliss. But I have to say I was sooo impressed by the FRUIT!!! It was the freshest I\\'ve ever had in a deli restaurant ever!!! Melon and cantaloupe yumm but the strawberries!!! Unbelievably sweet strawberries!!! OMG who is their produce buyer???

Although a good portion of the menu is sushi, they have a broad menu covering other cuisines which is good for my family because not everyone is a fan of sushi like me.\\n\\nFour of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.\\n\\nThe first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I\\'ll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.\\n\\nI enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which of course I had one wrap and the chicken was well seasoned in fresh, crispy lettuce. Portions were large and about 3 boxes of food had to be taken home giving us good value for the $52 price tag for our four person meal.	7	3	4

The name would indicate you have a vast selection of beers to entice and enrich the lives of beer nerds around the world. That is not the case. The selection was subpar at best. Very few regional beers, nothing I haven\\'t seen while grocery shopping. Though they are priced as if they were imported from the ends of the earth, delivered by golden knights on horse back. Disappointed to say the least. \\n\\nThe food however (priced cheaper than the beer in most cases) was on point. I had the pineapple jalapeno bbq burger on a pretzel bun, amazing. The Gilroy garlic fries with a side of cheese sauce, great flavor. My friend had the guacamole burger. Well seasoned, cooked perfect and reasonably priced. \\n\\nIf you want a good burger, they have them. The beer however, your better off someplace else.	1	2	0

As soon as you enter, you are transported into another world. The value for your dollar is incredible with a 6 course meal for just under $50. You get an excellent harira soup, assorted Mediterranean dip platter, shrimp scampi, filet mignon kabobs, chicken with couscous platter, and a phenomenal traditional dessert called bastilla. The bread that is served with the shrimp scampi is incredible, but be careful not to fill up as there is more food on the way!\\n\\nBeyond the food, there is great entertainment with music and belly dancers. They encourage audience participation as well!\\n\\nThe staff and ownership are quite attentive to your needs while not being overbearing.\\n\\nIt is an experience not to be missed if you are in the area. Make sure to save up room before you go because the food is plentiful, but they are also more than willing to pack up your leftovers to go.	1	0	0
